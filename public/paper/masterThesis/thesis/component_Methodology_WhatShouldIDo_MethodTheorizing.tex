%As already mentioned in the introductory chapter \refMissingSrc{Methodology Introduction}, I came to SÃ£o Paulo without prior knowledge of the city and without concrete but diffuse ideas about the purpose of my stay. So to say, the city drove me into the direction which is finally illustrated by this thesis. Most experiences and information approached me in a non-systematic manner because I was not looking for particular events nor situations or people, but tried to absorb and keep hold of everything.

%\inright{participant observation (PO) }
%For me, this premise seems optimal for conducting \aKeyword{Participant Observation }(PO). Even though PO serves as the basic framework for realizing research action(s), it does not appear to completely grasp the actions intention and their realization. As explained in more detail later on, PO can be seen as a method to \bracket{passively} observe scenes and situations. Therefore I would like to extend the concept of Participant Observation with the concept of \inright{participating observer} the \aKeyword{Participating Observer}, who actively participates in concrete action(s) and events as well, and by doing so, has an active impact on the form of those observation(s) that he or she wants to keep note of. 

%Finally,e I would like to fuse those three approaches, \aKeyword{Participant Observation}, \aKeyword{Participating Observer} and \aKeyword{Grounded Theory}, under the umbrella of \aKeyword{Action Research} (AR). The intentions and objectives inherent to AR are to a certain extend the intentions and objectives of this thesis. Especially the contention of the notion of \quote{knowledge} and its \quote{production}, that is articulated through AR, match the defined thesis' attitude to upgrade \quote{universally accepted} knowledge production mechanism driven by scholarly and academic discourse with the knowledge produced by the people, on a genuine participative and emancipatory manner. Hence for me, AR is  the hook for practical and theoretical research action(s).
