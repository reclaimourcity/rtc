\inright{deconstruction of participation}
The poster above is a wonderful opening for \deconstructing \participation. It says

\startCitation
I participate, You participate, he and she participates, We participate, You participate, They profit.
\stopCitation

and thereby precisely points to the deficiencies in the concept of \participation as it was meant back then and as it is meant today. This poster\footnote{A List of May 68 graffiti is documented at the \aLinkNewNoF[Bureau of Public Secrets]{http://www.bopsecrets.org/CF/graffiti.htm}} has been put on the streets in Mai 68, when students and workers gained momentum in 

\startCitation
the largest general strike that ever stopped the economy of an advanced industrial country, and the first wildcat general strike in history; revolutionary occupations and the beginnings of direct democracy; the increasingly complete collapse of state power for nearly two weeks; the resounding verification of the revolutionary theory of our time and even here and there the first steps toward putting it into practice; the most important experience of the modern proletarian movement that is in the process of constituting itself in its fully developed form in all countries, and the example it must now go beyond — this is what the French May 1968 movement was essentially, and this in itself already constitutes its essential victory. \aQuoteW{Bureau of Public Secrets}{1969}
\stopCitation

\quote{We all participate - We all benefit} is what one could excerpt out of this tiny insight. \Participation in putting revolutionary theory into praxis, overthrowing the capitalistic status quo for a while and genuinely participating in practising life with each other.

\quote{We participate - They profit} is what \participation is about in present \bracket{post-capitalistic} times. We are invited to participate in many things. We are invited to crowdsource the net, the user is the producer, we can Digg our most favourite blog post, we participate in the construction of social communities\footnote{From Facebook, to Orkut and Google+}, we can conveniently participate in social campaigns with a simple click, the marginalized and oppressed are invited in participatory development projects that seems to end their poverty or at least reduce it, crisis management during times of catastrophes incorporate citizen reports from the ground in order to be more effective and precise in providing help, its seems that we can even participate in the planning of our direct environment, our neighbourhood, when local governments decide to give us a tiny share of \bracket{evaluation} power or at least allows us to select our most favourite proposal for a new shopping mall right around the corner, we are told to show civil courage to help the people on the streets around the corner, at work we can participate in unions to fight for better working conditions \bracket{at least where unions are established}, and last but not least it seems that we may even participate in \bracket{the illusion of} impacting public politics by putting a vote once in a few years. 

Even though this listing is relatively arbitrary and polemical, it may show what is currently understood by \participation. We participate in proposals of others, our participation becomes their profit. We are invited to participate by those that have the power to invite us, that already decided what is the best for us, what we are supposed to do or that provides us with options for predetermined alternatives. This contemporary concept

highlights the fundamental point that participation without redistribution of power is an empty and frustrating process for the powerless. It allows the powerholders to claim that all sides were considered, but makes it possible for only some of those sides to benefit. It maintains the status quo. \aQuoteB{Arnstein}{1969}{216-224}
\stopCitation

This quote by \aQuoteInTextA{Sherry Arnstein} is excerpted from her \aQuoteInTextT{Ladder of Citizen Participation} that she has written from the standpoint of \participation of excluded neighbourhoods in housing and urban planning decisions in the US at the end of the sixties of the last century. It seems that still nothing has improved since then. 

The \Ladder illustrates and denounces hierarchies within concrete \bracket{citizen} projects, where the powerless and powerholders apparently \participate with the intention to \bracket{genuinely} propose ideas and articulate decisions about issues that bear direct constraints and necessities in the life of powerless.

The \Ladder serves as a basic starting point for \deconstructing \participation. Looking at \participationDe through the lenses of \powerStructures one could probably perceive more emerging issues caused by the \bracket{non}distribution of \powerDe. \Participation becomes \coopted and exploited by the powerholders to maintain the status quo, \participation becomes \depoliticized and does not aim to overcome structural inequalities beyond the local where where they are perceived most immediately. \Participation shrivels to a \technocraticMean to already predetermined ends.

\spaceHalf
\inright{1. non-distribution of \powerDe}
\ParticipationDe can currently be perceived as a form of tyranny, an \aQuoteInText{illegitimate and/or unjust exercise of power}\aQuoteB{Cooke and Kothari}{2001}{5-6}\footnote{which is further elaborated as \aQuoteInText{the tyranny of decision-making and control}, \aQuoteInText{the tyranny of the group} and \aQuoteInText{the tyranny of method}. Those forms of tyranny are for example visible in the concrete situation of meetings or discussion, where those with more experience in discussing for instance, or the better verbal skill set, do oppress the others by not letting them make their voice heard, discussing their arguments away.}. It does not eliminate structural inequalities but rather reproduces the structural \powerHierarchies that are causing them. In this sense, the status quo is maintained or further enforced, the marginalized remain marginalized and the powerful remain in power. Maintaining \powerStructures is done as long as people are merely invited into predetermined participatory spaces set up and controlled by the power holders.

[...] actions taken by the poor within the invited spaces of citizenship, however innovative, aim to cope with systems of hardship and are sanctioned by donors and
government interventions. \aQuoteB{Miraftab}{2006}{195}
\stopCitation

At \invitedSpaces, the powerless are manipulated and treated \aQuote{Sherry Arnstein}{1969}. Education and therapy are the means to provide the powerless with coping mechanisms for further survival in a persistent, structurally unequal, system. At \invitedSpaces, the powerless are informed, consulted and placated \aQuote{Sherry Arnstein}{1969} in order to to keep up appearances of good-practice while still controlling the flow of information and decision making.

[...]the ‘community’ has periodically been destroyed by underlying processes of development, only to be resurrected as the proper source of recovery through trustee-led intervention” \aQuoteB{Hickey and Mohan}{2004}{10}.
\stopCitation

\spaceHalf

\inright{2. \coopting the idea of participation for single sided benefits}
As \aQuoteInTextA{Hickey and Mohan} put it, the same \powerStructures that produced and produces structural inequalities and exclusion are now proclaiming salvation by inviting the oppressed to take part in fixing their situation. \aQuoteInTextA{Hickey and Mohan} write from the standpoint of \bracket{international} development agency and address its failure of not having entailed structural transformation for the people, a transformation of \powerDe that would be finally directly exercised by the people.

A widening of their perception could conclude that those power structures that caused and causes exclusion and discrimination in society, no matter the form, are now even benefiting by apparently genuinely offering space for participation, by inviting the different groups and individuals that compose society, thus most of us, by pretending that all voices are being heard, that the grassroots are being involved, eventually in order to remain in control, to prevent dissent and self-determination and thereby further exercise power, power over the people in street situation, the inhabitants of favelas, the students at universities, the inhabitants of social housing, or the workers in precarious service industries for instance.

\startCitation
It is a kind of theft – to take away the valuable things of the people and to put them to work in a system that is against the people but in favor of the powerful and the rich. Not only the municipalities and the politicians but also many of the NGOs and ‘civil society’ structures and activists are guilty of playing a part in this ongoing theft against the people. It can make you feel like your struggle was useless. You fight for justice – for equality and for the world to be shared – and you end up with the promise of ‘service delivery’.“ \aQuoteW{Abahlali baseMjondolo}{2010}
\stopCitation

\spaceHalf
\inright{3. \depoliticization of participation}
This type of \participation is stripped off the political dimension, it is depoliticised because its aim is not learning and understanding how existing structures of power, oppression and injustice operate \aQuoteB{Hickey and Mohan}{2004}{11} in order overcome them. Once those political questions are excluded, how can \participation bear any idea of genuine social transformation that leads to a just society? It is then merely a method, a means to a different end, an \aQuoteInText{empty ritual}\aQuote{Arnstein}{1969} that does not discover new and uncontested spaces shaped by the people, but that keeps them locked up in the current spaces of exclusion and powerlessness. \Participation becomes an obligation for every \quote{good citizen}, it becomes a must have for \quote{just} development projects, it is courteous for \quote{good governance practices} exercised by local, national and international institutions, but the structures of power never changes.

\startCitation
Western political thought has been that the central task of any political regime is education. The survival of the prevailing order depends upon depoliticizing young
people by making good citizens of them, by inviting, or even compelling them to participate. It is with good reason that we have long pathologized the figure of
the disengaged, apathetic youth, and groped frantically for therapeutic aids that might entice young people to participate (forgetting that time tends to make good
citizens of us all). And it is no wonder we have invested such hope in the potential of emerging media to engage young people and to encourage them to participate.
Participation, in the end, is truly much safer—and much easier to deal with—than politics. \aQuoteB{Barney}{2010}{145}
\stopCitation

\spaceHalf
\inright{4. participation as mere \technocraticMean to predetermined ends}
\Depoliticization reduces \participation to a mere method. Regimes of power \aQuoteInText{prove [...] participatory credentials} in their invitations to participate \aQuoteB{Hickey and Mohan}{2004}{16} but in turn just implement a \aQuoteInText{technical fix for complex problems of uneven development} \aQuoteB{Cleaver and Rahman in Hickey and Mohan}{2004}{59}. 

\Participation as such then renders an approach that is rather technocratic than social, that is more a tool then a process, where aim, methods and principle decisions have already been determined beforehand and that does not intend to envision a broader view that contest superimposed structural inequalities nor does it intend to distribute power. \Participation merely sticks within the limited scope of a particular project \aQuoteB{Hickey and Mohan}{2004}{10}.

\startCitation
On the one hand, privatization, deregulation, unemployment and ‘precarization’ of labour (and ‘structural adjustment’ programmes at the periphery and semiperiphery of the world-system); on the other hand, attempts to bring people to ‘take part’ in the management of local-level state crisis (along with other measures like repression and ‘state of emergency’, as long as they are necessary and feasible). \aQuoteB{de Souza}{2006}{335}

Summarizing the previously said, the \deconstruction \participation reveals several deficiencies that do prevent the empowerment and self-determination of the people.

Those deficiencies are not absolute nor do they occur all at once or have always equal shares. They shall primarily provide ground for critique of \participation as a mean for dis-empowerment and maintenance of the status quo. Deallocating these deficiencies from \participation could prepare the ground on which new meaning would be injected into its then empty shell. \aQuoteInTextA{Sherry Arnstein} remarks in her \aQuoteInTextT{Ladder of Citizen Participation}:

\startCitation
Obviously, the eight-rung ladder is a simplification, but it helps to illustrate the point that so many have missed - that there are significant gradations of citizen participation. Knowing these gradations makes it possible to cut through the hyperbole to understand the increasingly strident demands for participation from the have-nots as well as the gamut of confusing responses from the powerholders \aQuote{Arnstein}{1969}.
\stopCitation

Deficient \participationDe, \invitedSpaces, the powerless and power holders, are not just terms that represent a reality of development projects or other initiatives that explicitly addresses an excluded or discriminated group of people. \Participation pervades society and social relations independent from status or class, but it does not necessarily lead to a just society. 

\spaceHalf

\inright{invited participatory spaces are an expression of wider social power structures}
With \invitedSpaces I would not only refer to spaces determined by public and private institutions, the state, or \abbr{NGO}s. \InvitedSpaces could also be the spaces determined in struggle, by the grassroots or the civil society. They could be male dominated activist assemblies that structurally oppress female voices due to habits and apparently socially fixed norms, they could allow a vocal local elite to dominate discourse even in systems of horizontal decision making where everyone is supposed to have an equal voice, they could allow the majority society to oppress the needs and desires of minority groups. \PowerStructures starts to exists between people, determined by skills, different levels of education, their roles in predominant social discourses: about gender, \bracket{im}migration, race and colour, from where one is coming, in which area one is living. \PowerStructures exist thus not only between the poor and the rich, the have's and have not's.

\startCitation
In practice, because power relations between people are not addressed,
participation all too often involves only the voices of the vocal few and poor people
and women, in particular, tend to lose out, being marginalized and overlooked in
‘participatory’ processes. \aQuoteB{McEwan}{2005}{973}
\stopCitation

Deficient \participationDe means being detached from the processes that affects ones own life, being detached from the political space where those processes are shaped, being only invited to enter a predetermined participatory space that is not overlapping or touching the political one, thus remaining powerless with no means at hand for transformation. 

\startCitation
in the context of a hegemonic political and economic culture that not only accommodates participation but actually embraces, thrives, and insists upon it, and in light of proliferating technologies that effectively render routine participation obligatory, the ends that participation presently serves cannot be said to be unambiguously worthwhile. If we are looking for something to which we might attach our aspirations for a more just society, we might have to look for something other than mere participation. \aQuoteB{Barney}{2010}{144}
\stopCitation

\spaceHalf

\inright{deconstruction of the political space}
The answer to >the other< seems to be located in the political space. The \politicalSpace denoted so often seems to be the space where we want to \participate in but where we are structurally excluded from. \Participation in the \politicalSpace seems to be necessary in order to shape the processes that affects our life's but apparently this space is not accessible, it is determined and owned by \powerStructures that prevents us from transforming those spaces or that intends to keep us under control and maintain the status quo.

So, how should we proceed? Even though I intended to dismiss categories where possible I made plenty of use them, mainly in form of binary expression, thus words that represent opposite roles and positions such as the powerless and the powerholders or just and injust. I partition the world as I perceive it into distinct elements. This is what \JRanciere calls \aQuoteInText{the partition in the sensible} and this is where I would like to start with the \deconstruction of \politicsDe. \aQuoteInText{The partition in the sensible} is formulated as one thesis in his \aQuoteInTextT{Ten Theses on Politics}.

\startCitation
The partition of the sensible is the cutting-up of the world and of 'world;' it is the nemeïn [distribution] upon which the nomoi [laws] of the community are founded. This partition should be understood in the double sense of the word: on the one hand, that which separates and excludes; on the other, that which allows participation [...]. A partition of the sensible refers to the manner in which a relation between a shared 'common' [un communpartagé] and the distribution of exclusive parts is determined through the sensible. This latter form of distribution, in turn, itself presupposes a partition between what is visible and what is not, of what can be heard from the inaudible. \aQuoteB{Rancière}{2001}{6}
\stopCitation

%Die Aufteilung des Fühlbaren ist die untergliederung der Welt und "Welt". Es ist die Verteilung auf der die Gesetze der Gemeinschaft basieren. Diese Aufteilung sollte in den beiden Sinnen des Wortes verstanden werden: das was trennt und ausschließt; das was Teilhabe erlaubt. Eine Aufteilung des Fühlbaren bezieht sich auf das Wesen das die Verbindung eines geteilten Gemeinsamen und einer Verteilungung von exklusiven Teilen durch dach Fühlbare festlegt. Die zweite Form der Verteilung selbst erwartet schon eine Aufteilung zwischen dem was sichtbar ist dem dem was nicht, von dem das aus dem nichthörbaren zu hören ist.

I partition what I sense according to a quality and meaning that I probably learned somewhere or that I invent: the majority society, a minority group, the oppressed, the streets, social movements, capitalism, the excluded, the invisible, the neglected, occupations, collectives, solidarity, city of extremes, non-athoritarian. Not only do I partition, the world that I am continuously learning to \bracket{re}discover is already partitioned and qualified, continuously reshaped, pointing out the differences between its partitions.

\startCitation
The clash between the 'rich' and the 'poor,' for instance, is the struggle over the very possibility of these words being coupled, of their being able to institute categories for another (ac)counting of the community. \aQuoteB{Rancière}{2001}{6}

[...] In this fittingness of functions, places, and ways of being, there is no place for a \void.

\inright{what is the \void?}
What does it mean that there is no place for the \aQuoteInText{void}? Perhaps a look at the aim of social struggle is helpful. In the sense that I understand social struggle, it should lead to emancipatory social transformation by overcoming the status quo. A transformation should lead to a just society where oppressive and discriminating \powerStructures have been abolished. This in turn would mean the abolishment of  partitions, symbols, roles and functions that are structuring our being in a \aQuoteInText{world lived out of necessity}. The \aQuoteInText{void} should then be the space emancipatory struggle is directed to, the space of the people that do not take part, that do disturb the structure of the ordered world. In the \aQuoteInText{void} a category such as \peopleInStreetSituation, military police, sem terra, sem teto, \abbr{NGO}s, \abbr{GCM}, public and welfare politics, and the like, would not exist because they are expressions of structural inequalities, and that social struggle is about the eliminating and overcoming of those structural inequalities.

\inright{contemporary politics is police}
Contemporary politics as associated today with \bracket{local or national} governments, states, politicians, parties, unions, internationally acting institutions, the \bracket{global} economy, political campaigns and discourses within \bracket{mainstream} civic society, deny the existence of what is not supposed to be, the \aQuoteInText{void} as \aQuoteInText{the space of the people}, because there they would cease to exist. 

What is understood as politics today is called \aQuoteInText{the police} in the thesis of \JRanciere. \aQuoteInText{The police} is not necessarily what we associate with the police on the streets \bracket{which is a part of it anyway}. The \aQuoteInText{the police} \aQuoteInText{partitions the sensible} the world a perceivable order, in a structure whose components have names and meanings, are qualified according to various standards.

\startCitation
The police is not a social function but a symbolic constitution of the social. The essence
of the police is neither repression nor even control over the living. Its essence is a certain

The spaces that have been previously been called \politicalSpaces are transformed then into \policeSpaces. The exclusion from taking part in \policeSpaces is probably inevitable then because \policeSpaces are the space in which the \aQuoteInText{poor} are not supposed to be recognized or seen.

\startCitation
Political litigiousness/struggle is that which brings politics into being by separating
it from the police that is, in turn, always attempting its disappearance either by crudely
denying it, or by subsuming that logic to its own. Politics is first and foremost an

I think I need a break here i order structure things and my thoughts a bit. The \aQuoteInText{void} is that space that does not exist in the efforts of the \police to \aQuoteInText{partition the sensible}, thus the world we see and feel and perceive. The \aQuoteInText{void} is the space of those that are not supposed to he \aQuoteInText{take part}. Those that are not supposed to \aQuoteInText{take part} are the poor but not in the sense of material poor or what else we perceive as poor. 

\startCitation
The 'poor,' however, does not designate an economically disadvantaged part of the population; it simply designates the category of peoples who do not count, those who have no qualifications to part-take in arche, no qualification for being taken into account. \aQuoteB{Rancière}{2000}{4}

\inright{\participatorySpacesDe transform into \policeSpaces}
The \participatorySpacesDe referred to before should now turn into \policeSpaces as well. The praxis exercised there is that of the denial of the fact that the \aQuoteInText{poor} actually count. The praxis of those \participatorySpacesDe is eduction and treatment, mediation through information and consultation of the \aQuoteInText{poor} in order to prevent their part taking that should actually lead to a abolishment of structural inequalities that produced their roles and situations and functions and finally the entering of \participatorySpacesDe.

If there is someone you do not wish to recognize as a political being, you begin by not seeing them as the bearers of politicalness, by not understanding what they say, by not hearing that it is an utterance coming out of their mouths. And the same goes for the opposition so readily invoked between the obscurity of domestic and private life, and the radiant luminosity of the public life of equals. In order to refuse the title of political subjects to a category -- workers, women, etc... -- it has traditionally been sufficient to assert that they belong to a 'domestic' space, to a space separated from public life; one from which only groans or cries expressing suffering, hunger, or anger could emerge, but not actual speeches demonstrating a shared aisthesis [perception] \aQuoteB{Rancière}{2000}{6}.

\inright{what comes next, after politics?}
Looking at São Paulo for a while, the \aQuoteInText{partitioning of the sensible} is in full pace. The police on the streets and public policies of cleansing aiming to expel the people in street situation from commercial districts, the economical poor life in the peripheries out of sight or cannot afford the expensive public transport or access to university. \Luz is supposed to be transformed into a shiny district by expelling the old inhabitants of the \aLinkNew[Cortiços]{http://www.cefetsp.br/edu/eso/geografia/corticos261.html}\footnote{Cortiços are the predecessors of Favela. They are the places and agglomeration of houses where the excluded live, the oppressed, all those who don’t mix with the bourgeoisie \aQuote{Azevedo}{1890}.}and by trying to push the crack scene out of sight and out of mind. Denying what is not supposed to be then means that emancipatory social struggle is attempted not to be recognized by the \police, either by repressing it or by co-opting its demands and propositions. People in street situation are send to \bracket{remote} \Albergues or to the \Tendas to receive the treatment to their poorness there or to just silent them, demands to the \rightToTheCity enter the agendas of institutions such as the UNESCO \aQuote{Brown and Kristiansen}{2009} or the proper state, in Brasil in guise of the city statute\aQuote{da Silva}{2009}. The houses of the favelas in Zona Sul are \aLinkNew[demolished or evicted]{http://redeextremosul.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/mais-violencia-em-tentativa-de-despejo/}, the housing occupants in the cities centre face evictions to be just sent back to the peripheries, into social housing compounds literally located in a void lacking their social networks, their work opportunities \bracket{which are in the centre}, where public transport is too costly and time intensive to be utilized in order to reach the central areas of the city, or the university. Out of sight, out of mind.

By referring to the \aQuoteInText{Ten Thesis of Politics} by \JRanciere I tried to get to grasp what politics is not meant to be, that the current perception of \politicsDe, \policeSpaces and \participatorySpacesDe does not make them the prime spaces for transformation through social struggle because.

\Deconstructing \politicsDe also means to \deconstruct the notion of the poor as a simple category of people economically or material disadvantaged, poor in opposition to the rich. For me, perceiving the \aQuoteInText{poor} as those people that are not qualified to take part \bracket{from the standpoint of the \police} does not reduce non-participation and discrimination to those parts \bracket{or \aQuoteInText{partitions}} of society that are categorized as the marginalized \bracket{as I did in the title of this thesis}. Instead the \aQuoteInText{poor} are we all, all those that cannot take part in ruling and being ruled \aQuoteB{Rancière}{2001}{2}.

\startCitation
The formulations according to which politics is the ruling of equals, and the citizen is the
one who part-takes in ruling and being ruled, articulate a paradox that must be thought
through rigorously. [...] This formulation speaks to us of a being who is at once the agent of an action and the one upon whom the action is exercised. [...] It contradicts the conventional 'cause-and-effect' model of action that has it that an agent endowed with a specific capacity produces an effect upon an object that is, in turn, characterized by its aptitude for receiving that effect. \aQuoteB{Rancière}{2001}{2}
\stopCitation

So, the political as we know it is the \police that according to \aQuoteInTextA{Rancière} \aQuoteInText{partitions the sensible} world and denies the fact that there is a space, the \aQuoteInText{void}, where people do not need special qualifications to rule and being ruled, to take part. This \aQuoteInText{void} is \politicalRe. The \politicalRe emits subjects, us, the \aQuoteInText{poor} that are not qualified to take part and are unheard but that care, that struggle, we that we have nothing in common but the qualification of not having the qualification to rule. 

\startCitation
That the distinguishing feature of politics is the existence of a subject who 'rules' by the
very fact of having no qualifications to rule; that the principle of beginnings / ruling is

At present, the \aQuoteInText{void} is the political space, the space of \gotoTextMark[those who care]{methodology_whoami_socialmovements}. Its an intermediate space that currently does not include all people but just a fraction composed of the individuals, collectives groups and movements that struggle for emancipation.

Now, since it has been tried to deconstruct \participation and \politics, what is remaining? A view at São Paulo through the lens of spaces may be worthwhile. I could probably extend the understanding of the \aQuoteInText{partition the sensible} into fragments. Those fragments that are present in everyday life, the everyday spaces we life in, that we shape and that shape us.

The struggles fought in São Paulo are urban struggles, struggles fought in urban spaces, but also extend beyond the margins of the city, into the rural and in turn are impacted by the rural struggles. The narration of the \gotoTextMark[mini-feita]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_minifeira} probably has been insightful. So what is the city, how to decipher its spaces to benefit urban struggle? 

Much has been written about the city, the processes it reveals, the processes that transforms the city into \aQuoteInText{a world lived out of necessity} instead of a place 
of genuinely taking part in its production. I do not intend to repeat those analyses and just want to use one notion of \HLefebvre about the the city as he perceived it.

The ideal city, the New Athens, is already there to be seen in the image which Paris and New York and some other cities project. The centre of decision-making and the centre of consumption meet. Their alliance on the ground based on a strategic convergence creates an inordinate centrality. We already know that this decision-making centre includes all the channels of information and means of cultural and scientific development. Coercion and persuasion converge with the power of decision-making and the capacity to consume. Strongly occupied and inhabited by these new Masters, this centre is held by them. Without necessarily owning it all, they possess this privileged space, axis of a strict spatial policy. Especially, they have the privilege to possess time. Around them, distributed in space according to formalized principles, there are human groups which can no longer bear the name of slaves, serfs or even proletarians. What could they be called? Subjugated, they provide a multiplicity of services for the Masters of this State solidly established on the city. \aQuoteB{Lefebvre in Kipfer et al}{2008}{291}

The city described by \HLefebvre is comprehensively reflected on in \aQuoteInTextT{Space, Difference, Everyday Life}, a selection of essays drowning into the realms of \sspaces. My \deconstruction of the city and its \sspaces mainly draws on those essays. The \deconstruction of urban spaces should facilitate pointing out possibilities for transforming the city into an emancipated space, a \void in the sense of \JRanciere. It could also help to understand what has been bygone urban struggles have been lacking, such as the revolts in May 68 that have been introducing this chapter.

In retrospect, the claims to the city/difference of “1968” functioned more as a force of capitalist modernization than as a stimulus of counterhegemony. The mobilizations ultimately failed to energize potentially counterhegemonic (urban) strategies with longer time horizons. [...] Without a capacity to transform the energies of short-term mobilization into a sustained urban strategy of transformation, differentialist claims could thus be appropriated by the state, the bourgeoisie, and urban specialists for a process of commodifying the very form of the urban as centrality/difference [...]. In this situation, oppositional strategies have counterhegemonic potential only if they transform (rather than only assert) the minimal differences of commodified festivality, multiculturalized ethnicity, and racialized suburban marginality. \aQuoteB{Kipfer}{2008}{204}

Imagine for a moment the centre of São Paulo. What can be encountered there? A multitude of different spaces, inhabited by a multitude of people, undoubtedly, as it \gotoTextMark[has been attempted to illustrate]{narratinginquiries_intro}. It could also be seen that those spaces are strictly separated from each other \bracket{with some level of entropy}, they are partitioned and do not overlap. The city in form of its institutional agents practices a strategy of denial, of disposing the worlds that are not supposed to exist including its people, the worlds of those that do not take-part, that disturb her sense of public order, of tidiness. They try to expel them onto deposits,  where they are supposed to remain until when? And it is not only the institutions, its also the mainstream society that joins in, in denying help by not allowing people to distribute food in the centre, by fencing all kinds of urban architecture, by segregating urban infrastructure.

Even though a multitude of spaces exist, what prevails is only the imagination of how the city is supposed to look like. This is what \HLefebvre calls \minDifference. It is a homogenisation of the city, of its neighbourhood. Homogenisation in the sense that the cities spaces are supposed to look identically at last, that there remains nothing that disturbs the common conception of the city. Homogenisation manifest in architecture, in identically looking buildings, streets. Homogenisation manifest also as fragments/partitions with identical function scattered all over the place, districts for commerce and business, secure residential areas, areas for those that do disturb imagination. Homogenisation means society without difference.

\spaceHalf

\inright{perceived spaces}
Such physical spaces of \minDifference are a fraction of what \HLefebvre called \perceivedSpaces. The spaces of everydayness, where we life, where we work, where we struggle, where we are in motion.

\startCitation
Perceived space refers to the collective production of urban reality, the rhythms of work, residential, and leisure activities through which society develops and reproduces its spatiality. \aQuoteB{Ronneberger}{2008}{136}
\stopCitation

The spaces of \minDifference are shaping the cities, they shape the image of the city, its uniformity. Homogeneity means order, it aims for non-disturbance of those that cannot be homogenized. The spaces of \minDifference homogenise the cities from within and globally, according to similar schemas and similar concepts.

\startCitation
Neo-capitalist urbanization is explosion/implosion. It undermines city centers byscattering urban life into isolated parcels: bungalows (pavillons), districts of high-rise towers (grands ensembles), factory and university compounds, and resort towns on the beach. Demarcated by property divisions, transportation routes, and lines of functional and social segregation, these parcelized social spaces (planned in vulgar modernist fashion) represent forms of minimal difference.\aQuoteB{Kipfer}{2008}{201}

\inright{the production of space}
Looking only at \perceivedSpaces is not what \HLefebvre is suggesting. \PerceivedSpaces are just representing our perceivable world but they would be insufficient when trying to understand how space is produced. We struggle in produced space and while we probably ask \quote{How comes that we are struck in such a situation} when asking \WhoAreWe we will perhaps also ask what does the space we live actually articulate, what else then just consisting of concrete, bricks and asphalt.

\startCitation
Space is presented as the result of a concrete production process. For Lefebvre, things are not separate from space. He considers space as social product; the production of space may reveal social relations. Each mode of production produces its own space [...] \aQuoteB{Ronneberger}{2008}{136}

\inright{homogenisation and minimal difference}
\reference[deconstruction_mindiff]{}Space is a social product, it reveals social relations, it is where social praxis manifests, that what produces spaces, thus it is everything that makes a society and that can be made by society. Looking at how space is produced probably reveals the underlying structures and causes of homogenization of space inducing \minDifference. 

\startCitation
[...] minimal or “induced” difference is alienated particularity (individualism or group particularism) that tends toward “difference-as-sameness” and “formal identity.” Akin to the “diversity between villas in a suburb filled with villas” and the patriarchal “family cell,” minimally differential space dissociates everyday life, peripheralizes the working class, imposes much of the weight of reproduction onto women, and banishes new immigrants to “neocolonial” shantytowns and the worst public housing tracts. But minimally different spaces such as beach resorts extend “bourgeois hegemony to the whole of space.” Like bungalows, they promise a different, erotic appropriation of nature and body, embody hopes for non-instrumental human relationships, and nurture daydreams about freedom from repetitive drudgery even as they are managed with “identical plans” and strategies to foster predictable “rituals.” \aQuoteB{Kipfer}{2008}{201}
\stopCitation

The structures and causes for \MinDifference are revealed when we start looking at the production of the city in terms of \perceivedSpace: the physical spaces of everydayness, the objective spaces; of \conceivedSpaces: the symbols that we adhere or that are adhered to places in the city, the subjective spaces; of \livedSpace: the space of personal experience of social life, that reveals economic and social discrimination, that also reveals the reasons for economic and social discrimination, thus the space of struggle for transformation.

\startCitation
With this triadic model of the social production of space, Lefebvre tried to undermine dichotomies of structure and agency, discourse and practice.The schism between subjects’ perceived and lived spaces of activity and “objective” scientific- technological spatial structures is bridged by “ideologies of space.” [...] these ideologies articulate science with everyday life, render spatial practices coherent, guarantee the functioning of everyday life and prescribe modes of life. \aQuoteB{Ronneberger}{2008}{136} 
\stopCitation

\MinDifference follows the principles of the \police. It partitions the sensible into good and bad, into categories and functions and does not leave space for those that are not qualified to take part. \MinDifference prevents genuine \participation because it does not accept different opinions, it already predetermined the categories for togetherness. It do not allow \Catadores to work in the centre according to their principles of not-exploiting workforce for the profit of a few, it do not allow the occupation of abandoned real estate properties in central areas, instead it evicts the people and sends them back to the peripheries or the streets, simultaneously trying to clean up the same streets from those that disturb the image to \minDifference is promoting moreover accuses them to reduce the profit of businesses and commerce. \MinDifference does not only produce similar cities, architectural and functional wise, where everything becomes a commodity, land, space, culture, education, healthcare, it does not allow to people to take-part in the shaping of the city according to their ideas, it tries to control and direct social discourse, assign roles and presented as natural, the role of women, the role of men, the role of workers, the role of the poor. By doing so it prevents self-determined difference among the people, a \maxDifference, and loud cries for self-determination are either co-opted and internalized/institutionalized or denied//oppressed. \MinDifference does not re-distribute power, it keeps the order and prevents self-determination, the ruling of those that are not qualified to rule, the \poor. 

\startCitation
Everyday life, in a sense residual, defined by “what is left over” after all distinct, superior, specialized, structured activities have been singled out by analysis, must be defined as a totality. Considered in their specialization and their technicality, superior activities leave a “technical vacuum” between one another which is filled by everyday life. Everyday life is profoundly related to all activities, and encompasses them with all their differences and their conflicts; it is their meeting place, their bond, their common ground. And it is in everyday life that the sum total of relations which make the human—and every human being—a whole takes its shape and its form. In it are expressed and
fulfilled those relations which bring into play the totality of the real, albeit in a certain manner which is always partial and incomplete: friendship, comradeship, love, the need to communicate, play, etc. \aQuoteB{Lefebvre in Goonewardena}{2008}{124, 125}

%It is amazing how long it has taken for the problem of space to appear as a historical and political problem. Space was ascribed to “nature,” to the given, to immediate circumstances, to mere geography, to a part of pre-history, so to speak. Otherwise, space was conceived as living space and the space for expansion of a people, a culture, a language, a state. One analyzed space as land, as surface or as expanse: only space as such and its boundaries were important. 

%49
%The urban is, therefore, pure form; a place of encounter, assembly, simultaneity. This form has no specific content, but is a center of attraction and life. It is an abstraction, but unlike a metaphysical entity, the urban is a concrete abstraction, associated with practice8 . . . What does the city create? Nothing. It centralizes creation. Any yet it creates everything. Nothing exists without exchange, without union, without proximity, that is, without relationships. The city creates a situation, where different things occur one after another and do not exist separately but according to their differences. The urban, which is indifferent to each difference it contains, . . . itself unites them. In this sense, the city constructs, identifies, and sets free the essence of social relationships9 . . . We can say that the urban (as opposed to urbanism, whose ambiguity is gradually revealed) rises above the horizon, slowly occupies an epistemological field, and becomes the episteme of an epoch. History and the historic grow further apart.10

%The concepts of the urban and the rural \bracket{and for completion the peri-urban as the transition between the urban and the rural space} offers a good starting point to \deconstruct \spaceDe and consequently the \cityDe as well, the final themes of my \deconstruction proposals.

%\startCitation
%Under conditions of complete urbanization, “the city” is permanently undermined as a distinct social space physically demarcated from the (pre-capitalist) countryside. The old opposition between town and countryside is dialectically transcended into the contradictory relationship of center and periphery. \aQuoteInB{Kipfer et al.}{2008}{293}
%\stopCitaton

%The centre is all urbanized spaces including what is currently called the periphery, the areas far away from the geographical centre, and even metropolitan areas that are composed of several cities and everything in between. A \aQuoteIText{concentration of power} is inherent to the centre because it is the space of social practice where everything that composes society unfolds as simultaneously present and active. 

%This includes \bracket{urban} struggle as well as governance, control and social discourse. In the centres, all agents of power, the \police, are present. Power is concentrated in institutions as well as in corporate offices, the medias, in educational facilities but also in powerful social groups that acting according to theting 

%\startCitation
%Centrality is defined by the association and encounter of whatever exists together in one space at the same time. Thus it corresponds to a logical form: the point of encounter, the place of coming together. This form has no specific content. Its logic stands for the simultaneity contained within it and from which it results: the simultaneity of everything that can be brought together at one point. Centrality eliminates peripheral elements and condenses wealth, means of action, knowledge, information, and culture. Ultimately it produces the highest power, the concentration of powers: the decision.[...] Lefebvre argued that urbanization signaled the advent of new forms of global centrality: today’s cities are centers of design and information, of organization and institutional decision-making on a global scale. They are centers of decision and power that unite all the constitutive elements of society in a limited territory.
%\stopCitaton

%The periphery, the former countryside, is however not disconnected from the centre. The \aQuoteIText{contradictory relationship between centre and periphery} would suppose that the city cannot exist without the rural and that the rural is not apart from the city. This relationship is grounded in power. The centres are \aQuoteIText{concentrations of power} that is imposed onto the centres itself and onto the peripheries. 

%The city seen as the space of consumption reveals one face of the concentration of power. The city is supposed to be entirely consumable. Consumption does not only mean to go shopping. Consuming the city means \aQuoteIText{commodification of the city}, making its spaces, its land, its culture, its people profitable. The periphery is the site of production and exploitation that meet the consumption needs in the centre. 

%In São Paulo, housing movements and movements from the streets attack the commodification of spaces for living, the speculation with real estate. Self-Determined spaces and social movements practice their modes of learning based on common interest in opposition to the commodified educational system. \Catadores practice collective work instead of exploiting workforce. Rural movements are connected to urban movements by offering organic food collectively produced on occupied land.

%In recent years, the city has been reinvented as a positive socio-cultural category. Claims to oppositional centrality (street life, central-city living, festivity) and difference (multiculturalism, ethnic and sexual diversity, avant-garde cultural practice) can be traced to various urban movements since the 1960s. Today, superficial versions of these claims are integral components of bourgeois urbanism and gentrification—the result of the integration and cooptation of parts of the oppositional milieus into the metropolitan mainstream. At the same time, they represent a “rediscovery of the city,” a process that was initiated by innovative social groups and then spread out into wider social milieus. These processes could also be understood as more or less successful attempts of powerful social groups to appropriate and monopolize the urban as a productive force through various urban strategies which reduce maximal difference to minimal difference.

%\aQuoteInB{Prigge}{2008}{49}
%Lefebvre, however, connects the thesis of the dominance of the spatial to the present stage of capitalist societalization that is characterized, according to him, by the totalizing tendency of urbanization, and that, therefore, must cause an epistemological shift. It is no longer the industrial and its disciplines focusing on capital and labor, classes and reproduction that constitute the episteme (the possibility of knowing the social formation), but the urban and its forms focused on everydayness and consumption, planning and spectacle, that expose the tendencies of social development in the second half of the twentieth century.

%What does the city create? Nothing. It centralizes creation. Any yet it creates everything. Nothing exists without exchange, without union, without proximity, that is, without relationships. The city creates a situation, where different things occur one after another and do not exist separately but according to their differences. The urban, which is indifferent to each difference it contains, . . . itself unites them. In this sense, the city constructs, identifies, and sets free the essence of social relationships9 . . . We can say that the urban (as opposed to urbanism, whose ambiguity is gradually revealed) rises above the horizon, slowly occupies an epistemological field, and becomes the episteme of an epoch. History and the historic grow further apart.10

%\aQuoteInB{Prigge}{2008}{66,67} 
%The irreducible symbolic quality of spatial representations of daily social reality (the ideological hegemony of the spatial), the urban as the decisive episteme of the contemporary social structure (urbanity as the central apparatus [dispositif] of space) and the gulf between the spaces of subjective experience and objective perception (crisis of representation): how can this tangle of problems concerning an epistemology of space be unraveled? Lefebvre’s answer was a differentiated schema of the social production of space.

%\aQuoteInB{Kipfer}{2008}{201}
%The production of space is not agent-less. It is, at least in part, a result of concerted strategies. Key agents in making the production of space hegemonic are specialists of urbanisme: architects, planners, developers, specialized academics. Given Lefebvre’s broader claim about the centrality of the urban as a mediation of neo-capitalist totality, urbanists take on a strategic role as organic intellectuals in an urbanizing, neo- capitalist order. Urbanists give meaning to the practical-material aspects of city- building with disciplinary, fragmented knowledge (savoir) and through symbolic forms (monuments, advertising images). Both forms of conceived space assume and promote the political passivity and the affective involvement of users of space.The specialized, state-dependent knowledge of architects, planners, and urban designers treats urban space as a reified, thing-like object that imposes itself on the urban inhabitants from the outside, as it were

%%%\aQuoteInB{Kipfer}{2008}{201-202}

%\aQuoteInB{Kipfer}{2008}{203-204}
%Asserting a (maximal) right to difference implies a two-pronged quest for revolutionary transformation. In the more general sense, asserting a right to difference means laying claim to adifferent, no longer capitalist world defined by use- value relationships and generalized autogestion: the self-determination of all aspects of life, from workplaces to territorial units.81 This general differential quest is tied to a commitment to strip existing social differences of the very alienating, often state-sanctioned aspects (productivism, sexism, racism) that make them minimal in the here and now. Differentialist theory is intended to help move from affirming oppositional manifestations of difference to transforming these manifestations in a dialectically humanist fashion

%For Lefebvre, claims to “the right to the city” are the prism through which minimal difference may be transformed into maximal difference and fragments of abstract space may be connected in a quest to differential space. It helps to recall that Lefebvre treated the urban not only as a mediation of far and near order of totality. He also saw it as a (fleeting) form of centrality and difference, a point of convergence and “an ensemble of differences.”87 The right to difference is thus simply the flip- side of asserting the right to the city (centrality/power). Affirming the right to the city/difference does not mean celebrating actually existing manifestation of diversity per se, however. The liberal-pluralist diversity refers to reified forms of minimal difference (individualism, group pluralism).88 


%\aQuoteInB{Kipfer, Schmid, Goonewardena, Milgrom}{2008}{291,292}


%Lefebvre’s conception of the urban incorporates relationships between centers and peripheries.This relationship is not fixed in physical form. Once central social spaces (imperial capitals at the global scale or historic city centers at the scale of urban regions) can lose their status as centers of decision-making and control. At the regional scale, central functions of city centers can “implode” socially and economically while cities “explode” into far-flung metropolitan agglomerations. In turn, new centralities can emerge: new business districts, newly powerful urban centers of finance and state control. In all cases, the formation of centralities is predicated on processes of peripheralization—displacement, enclosure, segregation, exclusion.This takes place through both “coercion” and “persuasion,” incorporation and domination.



%\aQuoteInB{Kipfer, Schmid, Goonewardena, Milgrom}{2008}{}
%Nevertheless, Lefebvre offers a view of the urbanization process that is distinct from most others. He analyzes the urban not as accomplished reality but as possibility, a potential that is inherent in existing urbanization but can be realized only through fundamental social change: an urban revolution.The peculiar quality of this analysis is that it does not limit itself to a critique of the urbanization process but thinks through the implications of this process to lay bare its social possibilities.This reveals a potential that Lefebvre programmatically calls “urban society.”

%\aQuoteB{Barney}{2010}{144}

%The basic logic of citizenship is inclusion and participation; the basic logic of politics is exclusion and refusal. And this is why a culture of liberal democratic citizenship, a culture of the universalized invitation to participate, tends to produce politics only at and beyond its borders and margins. \aQuoteB{Barney}{2010}{144}

%\aQuoteB{Barney}{2010}{139}

%Participation, it would seem, is what citizenship is about. The prospect I would like to raise is that citizenship-as-participation is something altogether different from politics: that if participation, or taking part, is what citizenship is about, the possibility looms that neither citizenship nor participation necessarily conduces to politics. Indeed, as I suggest below, it may be the case that citizenship-as-participation is our best security against the possibility of politics.

%\aQuoteB{Barney}{2010}{144}

%at the very least they raise the question of the status of participation as both a political end and as a critical category under contemporary economic, social, and technological conditions. Participation is ambivalent, as open to stabilizing prevailing arrangements of power and injustice as it is to disrupting them. Thus, from a critical perspective, it would appear necessary to stipulate that participation is not an absolute, but rather only a contingent value: one whose worth is not intrinsic but rather derived from the ends it serves in any given context. Further, in the context of a hegemonic political and economic culture that not only accommodates participation but actually embraces, thrives, and insists upon it, and in light of proliferating technologies that effectively render routine participation obligatory, the ends that participation presently serves cannot be said to be unambiguously worthwhile. If we are looking for something to which we might attach our aspirations for a more just society, we might have to look for something other than mere participation. What we might actually need is politics, not just participation. It was suggested above that participation is what citizenship is about, but that citizenship-as-participation is something altogether different from politics. Much turns on what one thinks politics is, and on what one thinks politics is for.
