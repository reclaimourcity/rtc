\reference[narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_sundaystreetscentregibson]{} Today is the last Sunday of the month, its end of \toMark{June?}. I went to \Ay for collective vegan lunch that is organized \aLinkNew[every last sunday]{http://ay-carmela.birosca.org/node/334} of the month and met \Ma there. 

We met the first time at the free mapping festival \quote{você está aqui, mas por quê - UM FESTIVAL DE MAPEAMENTO LIVRE}\aLinkNewF[você está aqui, mas por quê]{http://ay-carmela.birosca.org/node/433}\aLinkNewF[i am here but why]{https://rtc.noblogs.org/post/2010/07/25/i-am-here-but-why/} in June. \Ma knows the streets of city inside out because he was in street situation more than a decade and just recently, some month ago, managed to leave the streets and moved into an apartment. 

He is hyper engaged in the struggle of the people because as he said, he constantly fears that people will continue to die on the streets because they lack everything and are prone to the violence on the streets. He refers to the massacre of 15 people in street situation in August 2004, killed by death squats of the military police and private security agents \aQuoteB{Dossiê}{2009}{63-64}\footnote{The mentioned Dossier is collaborative work of various civil society organisation and non governmental institutions and meticulously maps the illegal execution of people by institutional and state agents, by the police on the streets or in prisons for instance}\aQuoteB{o Trecheio}{2009}{1}\footnote{\aKeyword[O Trecheiro]{streets+journals+o trecheiro} is a street journal published by \aKeyword[Rede Rua]{streets+groups+rede rua} which includes reports written by \aKeyword[people in street situation]{streets+people+in street situation}} but also to the current \toTranslate[cleansing]{higienista} policy of the city which aims to \refMissingSrc{clean the the central areas} \bracket{Sé, República} off the people in street situation by putting them in social institutions such as the \refMissingSrc{tendas} at \locMissingSrc{Parque Dom Pedro}. More on this \gotoTextMark[later on]{text mark missing}.

\imgOTrecheiroMassacre

\Ma offered me a trip through the city, to show me around, literally, in order to get in touch with people in street situation but also to experience what is meant by {\bf being} in street situation, how we then have to organize our day and night, our food and shelter. While making this plan, here at the entrance of \Ay, a friend of \Ma is passing by, together with a teenager. It's \Gi, with whom I will spend some time \gotoTextMark[here]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_penaforte} and \gotoTextMark[there]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_padredecha}. \Gi says that he is accompanying the young guy because he cannot take care of himself. They are heading towards \locMissingSrc{Parque Dom Pedro} and \Gis stop and talk with us makes him quickly anxious continue their way. 

\Ma, like he is always doing, is introducing me, telling \Gi what I am doing in São Paulo, that we are making plans to stay on the streets. \Gi like he is always doing is super kind and wants says that he thinks that it is important that people outside Brazil get to know what is going on in São Paulo. \Gi does not stay long because his friend urges him to continue. \Gi says that he is dedicated to him today because he is still a very young guy, not long at the streets and he needs someone who shows him around, shows him the places that he should know. Before \Gi and his friend leaves we agree on meeting again later this afternoon, at the place where \Ma is living now.

Shortly after we are heading towards \Mas place. After arrival we first of all concreted our plan. \Ma said that we should stay one week on the streets, moving through different areas of the city, staying in the centre bus also moving to the east, Brás, Mooca, Belem. 

{\em I felt a bit uncomfortable because I just got acquainted to the city and did not feel ready for such a long trip.}

Our compromise is finally just an introduction, \gotoTextMark[two days on the streets]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_dayandnight}. 

Then \Ma showed and gave me a lot of material that he has been collecting about the struggle on the streets. He says that he is also a militant of the \abbrNew{Movimento Nacional da Populacão de Rua}{MNPR} and that he is taking now some time off to organize his own life and because he is fearing repression by police, that according to him is observing active members of \abbr{MNPR}. 

I asked him what he thinks about the \aKeyword{right to the city} but for him another question is much more important. The question of \aKeyword{access to the city}. Being formerly in street situation, this means access to educational facilities, access to decent work, access to a decent housing, access to participation in the cities decisions. For him, being on the streets means not having access at all, to nothing, not even food, being totally excluded.

Once \Gi arrived after a while we decided to take a walk back to \Ay and talk with people in \locMissingSrc{that area}. \Ma says that it is late enough in that afternoon to meet people there because they are arriving around that time in order to secure their space. 

We enter \aNewLocation[Rua do Carmo]{http://osm.org/go/M@ziKw9eb--} and pass by an \aKeyword[abandoned construction site]{streets+abandoned+construction site}, an unfinished high-riser, maybe 20 floors high, its red bricks exposed, no glass in its windows, on the second floor clotheslines packed with laundry to dry and in front of it, on the small court leading to the street, some children playing while people are leaving and entering the improvised ramp into the buildings interiors.

On the other side of the street some \aKeyword[blocked up and abandoned houses]{streets+abandoned+house} as well, colonial style.  At the corner to a back road there is a church. There we are heading towards, to the back road because there, people are declaring their space for the night to come, on the stairs to side entrances of that church.

\startARemark{hab ich noch ein bild davon oder von der straße?}
\stopARemark

There we meet a group of four guys. Neither \Gi nor \Ma know them but we are getting in touch with them right away. Two of them are already massively drunken, another one, probably the oldest is hectically talking and standing still, the fourth one, the youngest, is sitting with the other two on the stairs. \Ma introduces us and asks them to tell me a bit about their situation, telling them that I am in the city to get to know about the struggle on the streets. 

{\em For me this kind of situations have always been uncomfortable. I always feel somehow exposed as a stranger, somebody different, not belonging to the place or the people \bracket{which is how it is anyway}, even though my clothes are in similar bad conditions then of most of those I meet, even though I speak Portuguese and even though I its my demand for transparency that the people know directly why I am there at that particular moment. Here my role is that of a \aKeyword[passive observer]{role+passive observer} and this sometimes leads to arguing and reluctance.}

The hectically guy is asking immediately

\startCitation
\startlines
He: Does he understand Portuguese.
Me: Sure I do.
He: Then tell me, what does a guy from the first world do here in the third world? Why are you here? Don't you have problems to solve and analyse in your country?

The young guys interrupts and wants to know if I speak English as well.

\startAReminder{wie war nochmal der name von ihm?}
\stopAReminder

After affirming he is asking me questions about Germany in rough and broken English slang. He says that he has been to South Germany for a month on a trip with his religious youth group. He says that he is not from São Paulo, just arrived a month ago and went immediately to the streets. The hectic guy is interrupting us, asking:

\startCitation
\startlines
He: Do you believe in god?
Me: No, I don't.
He: Whooo, Irmãos, did you hear that, he is not believing in God. You are not a good person if you don't believe in god.
Me: So what, I believe in something else
HE: Whooo, did you guys hear that, he is not believing in God.
\stoplines
\stopCitation

Luckily, \Ma came to safe me but now he has to start arguing with the hectic guy:

\startCitation
\startlines
\Ma: Irmão, I lived on the streets for many years and I have never seen you in this area. You don't wanna tell me what I have to believe in or he.
\stoplines
\stopCitation

\Gi finally calmed everything down with his conciliatory way of arguing, telling the hectic guy that it does not matter in what we believe and that one religion is not better then another. What counts that we show solidarity for each other. Point.

The hectic guy, now calming down, but ready to start another ritual. This time he offers everybody to drink from a bottle they are sharing. In the meantime a car stops right at our side, the driver asking through the window

\startCitation
\startlines
\Ma: E aí irmãos, what's up? How are things going? Anything's going on around?
\stoplines
\stopCitation

The guys tell him that everything is relaxed, nothing special is going on. This seems sufficient for him and he drives away. Once the car is out of sight the hectic guy asks:

\startCitation
\startlines
\Ma: Irmãos, I wanna buy a new bottle. I need five Reais. Alemão \bracket{that is me}, can you spare some Reais?
\stoplines
\stopCitation

I gave him the five Reais note I was carrying with me, the others said they do not have money. The hectic guys takes them and disappears. We did not see him that afternoon again. Then \Ma has to leave as well, \Gi and me stay a bit longer. \Gi is talking to the two drunken guys and the young guy starts to talk with me again. After a while he says

\startCitation
\startlines
He: Alemão, I just wanna ask you if you can give me five Reais. Look, its nothing personal. I wanna tell you that we need Crack now and it's better for you to leave because it will become urgent soon and you probably don't want to be here.  It's really  important now because we had our last stone already some hours ago. So, do you have five Reais?
Me: Sorry , but I gave my money the other guy....
He: Look, its really important for us now. How long would it take if you go home get the money
Me: I live too far away. It would take 2 hours or so to come back...
He: Ok, the better get off soon and if you could get any money it would really help us much...
\stoplines
\stopCitation

\Gi is approaching me and we decide to leave because the situation will not become favourable for us, so its better to say good by and leave.  

While we are slowly walking towards \locMissingSrc{Sé} and further on to \locMissingSrc{República}, \Gi said:

\startCitation
\startlines
\Gi: It was good that we left, it was not safe anymore, they turn crazy when they need crack. And the next time you better don't give them money for alcohol. The one guy never came back and probably also went to get some crack. One stone is just five Reais.
