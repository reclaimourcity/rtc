How do theory and action go hand in hand? Finding an answer is the difficult part of this thesis. It is difficult because my concept of knowledge and its production is different from the academic concept. 

When choosing \abbrFull{AR} as \gotoTextMark[research framework]{methodology_whoami_actionresearch}, I defined that my aim of knowledge production and theorizing is neither universal validity not generalized abstraction. Thus I do not intent to formulate a general theory from the insights gained during my research actions in São Paulo nor do I intend to prove or disprove any existing theory. 

My thesis is a locally focused, its research actions are limited to just a \gotoTextMark[couple of districts]{methodology_whoami_experience_locations} in the centre of São Paulo. One of its \aKeyword[objectives]{objectives+theorizing} is the \gotoTextMark[raising of awareness and consciousness]{methodology::whatdoiwant::theorizing} about the realities on the streets, from the standpoint of the \gotoTextMark[people that are living in the situation of the streets]{methodology_whatshouldido_methodparticipantobservation_pc}. Another \aKeyword[objective]{objectives+theorizing} is the \gotoTextMark[mutual nurturing]{methodology::whatdoiwant::theorizing} of \aKeyword[academic space]{space+academic} and \aKeyword[movement space]{space+movement} in order to converge and benefit the theorizing emerging from those very different spaces.

I argued \gotoTextMark[already]{methodology_whoami_actionresearch_mystandpoint} that I narrate from a subjective position, the position of the people, the position of movements, my position, that is biased because it represents knowledge that is shaped by practice of struggle, that is situated in the reality of struggle, that is lacking requested academic objectivity and is not based on systematic surveying in order to be useful for academic purposes. Narrating helps to articulate \aKeyword{who we are} and \aKeyword{what we want}, expressing \gotoTextMark[our perspective of the space we live in]{methodology_whatshouldido_methodparticipantobservation_pc}.

Narrative inquiry (CONNELLY \& CLANDININ 1988) allows us to explore our personal histories in an effort to understand how who we are impacts on what we value and what we do. The "evidence" consists of narrative accounts of significant moments in our past which helps us understand our values and provides insight into current decision-making. There may be elements of documentary evidence, but on the whole the evidence consists of the narrative reconstruction of incidents which we believe to be important for understanding who we are \aQuoteW{Newman}{2000}\footnote{I found this quote appropriate even though it expresses an approach to action research as personal perspective of a teacher}.
\stopCitation

On the other hand, I do not deny the signification of academic theorizing, I only argue that I do not \toMark{conform to follow academic norms} in my process of theorizing and knowledge production because I consider the knowledge in this thesis as part of a particular social space, constructed from the standpoint of the people and collectives that are living and struggling in the real urban space in São Paulo.

\startCitation
In the same way, a primary use of ‘‘social construction’’ has been for raising consciousness. This is done in two distinct ways, one overarching, the other more localized. First, it is urged that a great deal (or all) of our lived experience, and of the world we inhabit, is to be conceived of as socially constructed. Then there are local claims, about the social construction of a specific X. The X may be authorship or Zulu nationalism. A local claim may be suggested by an overarching attitude, but the point of a local claim is to raise consciousness about something in particular. Local claims are in principle independent of each other. You might be a social constructionist about brotherhood and fraternity, but maintain that youth homelessness in real enough \aQuoteB{Hacking}{1999}{6}.
\stopCitation

In São Paulo, many people are frequenting the centre of the city, the lived space that the centre represents for them, but ones own knowledge about that space is certainly different if one is seeking a place to sleep on the streets day by day, repressed by police and institutional agents, seeking for cardboard to collect and sell or if one is frequenting the bars, the shopping malls or the office, running ones own legal business there. In those few examples I encounter already different perspectives of the same space, different lived spaces so to say, which are resulting in the production of different knowledge about them, knowledge of those that are repressed and knowledge of those that are benefiting, for instance.

But coming back to the initial question. I will first take a look at common options I would have in academic terms. My selection here refers to the so called \refMissing{inductive-deductive} approach.

What I feel contradictory in applying an inductive-deductive approach is that it is meant to analytically and systematically prove or disprove a theory or to formulate a new one. 

When choosing action research I have chosen my standpoint and defined what I intend to do by narrating, by producing qualitative but unsystematic accounts of experiences and gained insights. Those narrations do not serve to prove or disprove a particular theory. They serve to narrate and theorize from our standpoint, to filter out particular concepts and ideas that are implicitly embedded in the struggle \bracket{embedded in the sense that peoples claims for participation, citizenship, right to the city, self-determination are also subject of academic theorizing}. By \bracket{critically} reflecting on each standpoint we can benefit our and academic theorizing, trying to find ways of converging both spaces, trying to benefit our struggle.

%As principle scientific scheme I have chosen the \quote{inductive-deductive} model of \refMissingSrc{inductive-deductive model}

%\imgThesisTheroy

%\startADefinition
%{\bf inductive} procedures originate from particular situations, the local, which is supposed to be verified against a theory. Usually, a corresponding theory already exists and no new theory is supposed to be formulated. The local is always a snapshot of a particular situation which cannot be easily generalized by default. The conclusions drawn from the local can be used to adjust, support or object existing theories. Therefore, the local is described and represented by empirical data which is supposed to be representative and reliable enough to be considered valid for the contention or adjustment of the corresponding theory.
%\stopADefinition

%\startADefinition
%{\bf deductive} procedures originate from theory, the general, which is supposed to be translated to the local, to particular situations, where it can be validated and proved. On the local it shall be verified whether the proposed theory is valid or not or if it needs adjustments. On the local this is done with empirical data which is supposed to be representative and reliable enough to evaluate the correspondingly formulated theory. 
%\stopADefinition

%\spaceHalf

%\startADefinition
%In contrast to theory, \inright{empricism: a brief definition} empiricism observes situations and draws conclusions that cannot be explained and derived in a formal or logic manner, such as a mathematical formula. In order to derive conclusions, empiricism is supposed to be performed in a systematic and objective manner, grounded on \toMark{(reliable and analysable)} data and information, \toMark{ref missing}, the base of \toMark{western} science. This shall distinguish empiricism from observing randomly occurring daily life experiences, which are claimed to be non-producible in a systematic manner \toMark{ref missing}. Empiricism means therefore systematic inquiry of the daily life.
%\stopADefinition

%\spaceHalf

%\inright{observation: open and non predictable}
%In stark contrast, other types of research actions rely on observations that do not claim to be systematic and which question the objectivity of gathered data and reproducibility of situations. Those observations may occur when neither the concrete local context is known in advance by the research agent, nor the outcome of the research is clearly defined. Therefore, necessary knowledge has to be gained in the first place in order to formulate frame of research and action(s). This knowledge is composed of rather daily situations, realities and conditions, which are not predictable beforehand and which affect and construct the frame research is bounded by.

%\inright{open local observations and narratives do not fit with empiricism}
%Therefore, this thesis can not be considered empirical because the narratives of particular situations, experiences and observations made in São Paulo had to be made in an unsystematic manner due to the fact that the whole local context was unknown to me. Hence, the unawareness off the city of São Paulo, the thousands of realities it represents, the complexity of its social and political structures, the whole universe called São Paulo, automatically implies that unsystematic observation and participation is one of the viable options that allow to dig a bit deeper than just to scratch on the surface. 

%For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that another option would have been the participation in an existing institutional project. For me this would have been antipodal to the intended non-hierarchical/non-authoritarian approach due to the fact that an existing project already represents a fixed frame, hierarchies are already established and existing (institutionalized) social networks have to be utilized. The fixed frame leaves little space for navigation and by that the thesis could have been degenerated to the mere achieving of the title and the fulfilment of project goals, no matter if reasonable and justifiable or not. Thus, project based thinking and working would have prevailed. This type of thinking was supposed to be pushed aside for and during this thesis.

%\spaceHalf

%\inright{relevance of theoretical versus observed and experienced information}
%In the end, if one argues about relevance in the context of this thesis, personal observation and participation contemplates those complex realities that are rather invisible in daily life and public discourse, while theory can primarily be used to translate those realities into another form. Thus, talking about those realities is relevant for the thesis, because then, this thesis and its information could become another mosaic that composes the struggle of those people that facilitated the insight in and cognition of the city of São Paulo and their realities and by that impacted and shaped the current form of this thesis. Relevance for the thesis means relevance for the people and vice versa. The question of relevance is crucial here because research actions were cooperative work and cannot be divided into research agent and research target. Thus research outcome, apart from putting everything into the form of a thesis, is cooperative work as well, thus work we have done together, and which is relevant for us. 

%{\em In other words, this thesis has been shaped from and is drawn on concrete but unsystematic experiences, observations and actions, thus cannot be considered as a thesis of empirical origin or with empirical focus.}

%While being in São Paulo, it became clear over the course of the first two month that moving through the city means learning how the city functions. This meant to learn how to use public transport, how to use and impropriate the city in order to loose the fear of getting lost. Further on it meant to impropriate the slang of the streets and finally to get in touch with the people, in this case with the people that live and work on the streets. 

%What became evident was the fact that new dimensions of the city emerged after social relations had been established. Those dimensions are partly invisible in daily life (more on this later on) and can often just be perceived if one spends hours together on the streets, hanging around or walking from one spot to another and by that circling through the city, hearing many stories, perceiving many situations, such as this emblematic one:

%The experience of being on the streets, embedded in and being a part of a network of people, lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the city, its dimensions and realities. This comprehension also means that any research based on quantitative measures, would have failed or at least led to wrong assumptions because any questions and situations imagined before hand would have been non-relevant (in the sense as stated in this chapter), due to the lack of understanding of the city, the situation of the people and a biased European perspective. 

%\startADefinition
%{\bf quantitative} \inright{data sets, normalisation, indicators, statistics, calculus, theory generation, theory prove}
%{\em methods generate quantities, thus relatively large amounts of normalized and standardized data sets. These sets can for example be generated by conducting surveys, a classical method where copies of a set of questions are distributed to many people, probably several hundreds or more, and where an analysis of the received answers is performed afterwards, when all surveys had been re-collected. Analysis can be done statistically for example, because surveys are usually standardized to a set of questions (every participant receives the same questions so to speak) that are related to one or more indicators. An indicator is a \toMark{formal} representation of a specific domain of interest: if a survey asks about your housing condition (rent, squatted, property, homeless, etc), a related indicator could represent the domain of \quote{housing-types} or something else. Thus quantitative approaches are about (relatively) large amounts of data and information, normalisation, indicators, statistics and calculus. Quantitative approaches inherently generalize the made observations because collected data sets usually contain large numbers of entries and are often considered representative (though not all-encompassing), thus generalizable.
%}

%{\bf qualitative} {\em }  \inright{non standardized, interpretative, comprehensive, theory extension, theory adoption}
%{\em methods generate comprehensive data, thus sets of information that could represent a particular context in order to understand its meaning in a comprehensive, holistic or qualitative manner. This data is not meant for statistical analysis even though it can be related to indicators as well, but due to the small size of data-sets equipped with a large amount of non standardized context information, statistical analysis renders not feasible. Therefore, analysis is often done in interpretative ways. Referring to the quantitative example, qualitative data would not only ask about the housing type, but probably also about the materials it is constructed of, the neighbourhood, the age  and once an answer doesn't fit  (i.e. no house but the streets) the process of information gathering can be adjusted to the new situation. In addition, those information may be gathered during an interview or a talk, thus involves inter-personal communication and personal opinions. Qualitative approaches do not generalize because the number of data sets, though comprehensive, are not sufficient to draw a general picture from it, maybe just a small picture from a small spot. Therefore, qualitative information and analysis can be used to extend or adjust existing knowledge by new facets.
%}
%\stopADefinition

%Quantitative approaches require access to a relatively large group of people and other resources of knowledge. Several drawbacks emerge from that necessity: 

%\spaceHalf

%\inright{enforced power hierarchies due to distance and impersonality: definition shapers still rule information providers}
%The relative distance and impersonality to people, which is immanent due to the fact that a large group is addressed. This impersonality and distance can be seen as a hierarchy between the research agent and the research participants. The participants are solely perceived as information providers and not as participants (in the sense discussed in the \toLink{participation chapter}). This form of participation just means outsourcing the information generation process while keeping the powerful position of defining (probably wrongly) which type of information is necessary or relevant. Here we enter the question of power again which is supposed to be dissolved in the course of this research.

%\spaceHalf

%\inright{dissolution of power hierarchies requires genuine participation}
%Dissolution of power hierarchies means that people are involved in shaping the whole process of research. This would mean that decisions about the relevance of research, the type of research objectives, the provided information and the usage thereafter are decided together with and by the people. In order to accomplish this situation one would require access and involvement in the peoples networks and communities. This accomplishment would require much more time then granted by the institutional framework this thesis is embedded in and is therefore impossible to achieve.

%\spaceHalf

%\inright{generalization leads to elision of the margins}
%The motivation of gathering large sets of data is usually to be able to generalize analysis, by proving previously formulated hypotheses or by creating new theories. Due to the fact that collected data sets seldom represents the whole spectrum of variants and possibilities, generalization do not cover all aspects of the area of interest, which could be no problem in certain areas, such as the measurement of rainfall, but should be taken in mind when actions are socially motivated and generalization may lead to the exclusion of the margins of society. Thus, generalization is problematic for this research because no one shall be elided.

%\spaceHalf

%\inright{lack of local knowledge leads to wrong perceptions}
%A quantitative approach applied for this thesis research, such as a survey, that had been designed before hand, during preparation of the research, without the concrete knowledge of the city, would have been composed of assumptions that led astray. 

%\spaceHalf

%\inright{qualitative shortcomings and benefits}
%The previously mentioned drawbacks are party dismantled by going qualitative rather than quantitative. Qualitative approaches can have similar shortcomings than quantitative ones, depending on the type of approach and the motivation of its application. 

%The question of information gathering in the qualitative context can lead to similar, wrongly made assumptions than already explained above, due to the fact that local knowledge must be gathered somehow. Thus, a qualitative interview based on wrong perceptions and lack of local knowledge can lead to the same misleading assumptions than a wrongly designed quantitative survey. 

%On the other hand, qualitative approaches do not aim to be generalizable, hence inherent to the access to local knowledge is the process of becoming part of the peoples networks and communities, on a much smaller scale, probably just on interpersonal or group level. Thus decisions and discussions about research, its relevance, its objectives and so forth can be mediated directly by and with the people. This process also requires time and trust between each other but could open other viewpoints on research for all. 

%If we return to the notions of hierarchy and emancipation, one could argue that the processes of becoming acquainted with people, building relations and being together, already provides plenty of space for acting in a non-hierarchical, non-authoritarian and emancipatory manner. This possibilities are of course not absolute nor are they vested due to the fact that power hierarchies pervade all aspects of social life of individuals and groups, thus are always visible or perceivable \toMark{ref missing?}.

%However, having the possibility to observe and take part in a genuine participatory manner opens up spaces that would not have been reached just through plain non-genuinely-participatory approaches. A note from São Paulo that certainly impacted the way I see the relevance and significance of my research, may illustrate this claim.

%\startCitation
%After I met \toMark{Matheus} one day at \toMark{Ay Carmela (a self-organized centre)}, we fixed a date when he was going to show me the streets where he lived for 15 years, in the centre of São Paulo. First we planned to spend one week on the streets but later reduced that time to two days. What I have seen and experienced in those days is barely comparable to informations gathered through semi-personal surveys or interviews which would have failed to transport the intensity and manifoldness of situations. This trip on the streets gave me answers to questions that I wouldn't have been able to formulate in advance and once it passed it wasn't necessary to ask any more because everything had already been unfold \aQuoteP{2010}.
