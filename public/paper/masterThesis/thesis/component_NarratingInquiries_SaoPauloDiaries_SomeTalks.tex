I would like to start with a citation by \aQuoteInTextA{Cleisa Moreno Maffei Rosa}:

\startCitation
No entato, ficavam à mercê do controle burocrático exercido pelos órgãos governamentais e, no limite, reiteravam aões imediatistas ligadas à higiene e alimentação, destituídas de conteúdo de natureza socioeducativa. Algumas organizações procuravam sobreviver sem verbas públicas, mas - a duras penas - recorriam a apoio de grupos solidários.

Não havia pesquisas, estudos ou levantamentos atualizados sobre essas questões, nem mesmo programas alternativos quo apontassem para autonomia das pessoas attendidas nos serviços e particpação nas decisões institucionais - elementos fundamentais à conquista da cidadania da população de rua\aQuoteB{Rosa}{2005}{174}.\footnote{In the meantime we remain at the mercy of bureaucratic control exerted by governmental bodies and, at maximum, reiterate the immediate need of hygiene and alimentation, stripped-off the content of socio-educative nature. Some organisations are seeking to survive without public aid, but - with heavy legs -  run after the support of solidary groups. There exist no research, study or contemporary inquiry about those questions, no alternative programs that are directed to the autonomy of the people received at the public services or to participation in institutional decisions - fundamental elements for conquering citizenship for the street population}

\subjectAy

\reference[narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_sundaystreetscentregibson]{} Today is the last Sunday of the month, its end of July. I went to \Ay for \aKeyword[collective vegan lunch]{streets+actions+collective lunch} that is organized \aLinkNew[every last sunday]{http://ay-carmela.birosca.org/node/334} of the month and met \Ma there. 

We met the first time at the free mapping festival \aKeyword[você está aqui, mas por quê - um festival de mappeamento livre]{streets+actions+festivals+festival de mappeamento livre}\aLinkNewF[você está aqui, mas por quê]{http://ay-carmela.birosca.org/node/433}\aLinkNewF[i am here but why]{https://rtc.noblogs.org/post/2010/07/25/i-am-here-but-why/} in June. \Ma knows the streets of city inside out because he was in street situation more than a decade and just recently, some month ago, managed to leave the streets and moved into an apartment. 

He is super engaged in the struggle of the people because as he said, he constantly fears that people will continue to die on the streets because they lack everything and are prone to the violence on the streets. He refers to the massacre of 15 people in street situation in August 2004, killed by death squats of the military police and private security agents \aQuoteB{Dossiê}{2009}{63-64}\footnote{The mentioned Dossier is collaborative work of various civil society organisation and non governmental institutions and meticulously maps the illegal execution of people by institutional and state agents, by the police on the streets or in prisons for instance}\aQuoteB{o Trecheio}{2009}{1}\footnote{\aKeyword[O Trecheiro]{streets+actions+journals+o trecheiro} is a street journal published by \aKeyword[Rede Rua]{streets+actors+groups+rede rua} which includes reports written by \aKeyword[people in street situation]{streets+standpoints+in street situation}} but also to the current \toTranslate[higienista]{cleansing} policy of the city which aims to \refMissingSrc{clean the the central areas} \bracket{Sé, República} off the people in street situation by putting them in social institutions such as the \refMissingSrc{tendas} at \locMissingSrc{Parque Dom Pedro}. More on this \gotoTextMark[later on]{text mark missing}.

\imgOTrecheiroMassacre

\inright{metting \Ma and \Gi for a trip through the centre}
\Ma offered me a trip through the city, to show me around, literally, in order to get in touch with people in street situation but also to experience what is meant by {\bf being} in street situation, how we then have to organize our day and night, our food and shelter. While making this plan, here at the entrance of \Ay, a friend of \Ma is coming around, together with a teenager. It's \Gi, with whom I will spend some time \gotoTextMark[here]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_penaforte} and \gotoTextMark[there]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_padredecha}. \Gi says that he is accompanying the young guy because he cannot take care of himself. They are heading towards \locMissingSrc{Parque Dom Pedro} and \Gis stop and talk with us makes him quickly anxious continue their way. 

\Ma, like he is always doing, is introducing me, telling \Gi what I am doing in São Paulo, that we are making plans to stay on the streets. \Gi like he is always doing is super kind and says that he thinks that it is important that people outside Brazil get to know what is going on in São Paulo. \Gi does not stay long because his friend urges him to continue. \Gi says that he is dedicated to him today because he is still a very young guy, just recently entered the streets and he needs someone who shows him around, shows him the places that he should know. Before \Gi and his friend leaves we agree on meeting again later this afternoon, at the place where \Ma is living now.

\spaceHalf

\inright{at \Mas place}
Shortly afterwards we are heading towards \Mas place. After arrival we first of all finalized our plan. \Ma said that we should stay at least one week on the streets, moving through different areas of the city, staying in the centre but also moving to the east, Brás, Mooca, Belem. 

{\em I felt a bit uncomfortable because I just got acquainted to the city and did not feel ready for such a long trip.}

Our compromise is finally just an introduction, \gotoTextMark[two days on the streets]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_dayandnight}. 

Then \Ma gave me a some material that he has been collecting about the struggle on the streets. 

\startARemark{hier können fotos von den sachen die \Ma mir gegeben hat rein}

He says that he is also a militant of the \abbrNew{Movimento Nacional da Populacão de Rua}{MNPR}, the \gotoTextMark[movement of the population in street situation]{go to text mark missing},  and that he is taking now some time off to organize his own life and because he is fearing repression by police, that according to him is observing active members of \abbr{MNPR}. 

I asked him what he thinks about the \aKeyword[right to the city]{streets+aims+right to the city} but for him another question is much more important. The question of \aKeyword[access to the city]{streets+aims+access to the city}. Being formerly in street situation, this means access to educational facilities, access to decent work, access to a decent housing, access to participation in the cities decisions. For him, being on the streets means not having access at all, to nothing, not even food, being totally excluded. 

Once \Gi arrived we talked about the perception \quote{the society} has about the people in street situation and other marginalized groups

\startDialog
\tell{\Ma}{Do you know how they call us in the media, what society thinks of us? They call us \toMark{Noia, Vagabundo, Zumbi}, what else...?}

\tell{\Ma}{...Bicho, they call us bicho! You see? This is what people think of someone living on the streets, someone not human, an animal...}

\inright{walking to the centre}
After a while we decided to take a walk back to \Ay and talk with people in \locMissingSrc{that area}. \Ma says that it is late enough in that afternoon to meet people there because they are arriving around that time in order to secure their space for the night. 

We enter \aNewLocation[Rua do Carmo]{http://osm.org/go/M@ziKw9eb--} and pass an \aKeyword[abandoned construction site]{streets+places+abandoned+construction site}, an unfinished high-riser, maybe 20 floors high, its red bricks exposed, no glass in its windows, on the second floor clotheslines packed with laundry to dry and in front of it, on the small court leading to the street, some children playing while people are leaving and entering the improvised ramp into the buildings interiors.

On the other side of the street some \aKeyword[blocked up and abandoned houses]{streets+places+abandoned+house} as well, colonial style.  At the corner to a back road there is a church. There we are heading towards, to the back road because there, people are declaring their space for the night to come, on the stairs to side entrances of that church.

\inright{meeting four guys}
\reference[narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_sundaystreetscentrefourguys]{}There we meet a group of four guys. Neither \Gi nor \Ma know them but we are getting in touch with them right away. Two are already massively drunken, another one, probably the oldest is hectically talking and standing still, the fourth one, the youngest, is sitting with the other two on the stairs. \Ma introduces us and asks them to tell me a bit about their situation, telling them that I am in the city to get to know about the struggle on the streets. 

\startPersonal
For me this kind of situations have always been uncomfortable. I always feel somehow exposed as a stranger, somebody different, not belonging to the place or the people \bracket{which is how it is anyway}, even though my clothes are in similar bad conditions then of most of those I meet, even though I speak Portuguese and even though I its my demand for transparency that the people know directly why I am there at that particular moment. Here my role is that of a \aKeyword[passive observer]{streets+roles+passive observer} and this sometimes leads to arguing and reluctance.
\stopPersonal

\reference[narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_sometalks::hecticguy]{}The hectically guy is asking immediately:

\startDialog
\tell{He}{Does he understand Portuguese.}
\tell{Me}{Sure I do.}
\tell{He}{Then tell me, what does a guy from the first world do here in the third world? Why are you here? Don't you have problems to solve and analyse in your country?}
\stopDialog

The young guys interrupts and wants to know if I speak English as well.

\startAReminder{wie war nochmal der name von ihm?}
\stopAReminder

After affirming he is asking me questions about Germany in rough and broken English slang. He says that he has been to South Germany for a month on a trip with his religious youth group. He says that he is not from São Paulo, just arrived a month ago and went immediately to the streets. The hectic guy is interrupting us, asking:

\startDialog
\tell{He}{Do you believe in god?}
\tell{Me}{No, I don't.}
\tell{He}{Whooo, Irmãos, did you hear that, he is not believing in God. You are not a good person if you don't believe in god.}
\tell{Me}{So what, I believe in something else...}
\tell{He}{Whooo, did you guys hear that, he is not believing in God.}
\stopDialog


Luckily, \Ma came to safe me but now he has to start arguing with the hectic guy:

\startDialog
\tell{\Ma}{Irmão, I lived on the streets for many years and I have never seen you in this area. You don't wanna tell me what I have to believe in or he.}
\stopDialog

\Gi finally calmed everything down with his conciliatory way of arguing, telling the hectic guy that it does not matter in what we believe and that one religion is not better then another. What counts that we show solidarity for each other. Point.

The hectic guy, now calming down, but ready to start another ritual. This time he offers everybody to drink from a bottle they are sharing. In the meantime a car stops right at our side, the driver asking through the window

\startDialog
\tell{\Ma}{E aí irmãos, what's up? How are things going? Anything's going on around?}
\stopDialog

The guys tell him that everything is relaxed, nothing special is going on. This seems sufficient for him and he drives away. Once the car is out of sight the hectic guy asks:

\startDialog
\tell{\Ma}{Irmãos, I wanna buy a new bottle. I need five Reais. Alemão \bracket{that is me}, can you spare some Reais?}
\stopDialog

I gave him the five Reais note I was carrying with me, the others said they do not have money. The hectic guys takes them and disappears. We did not see him that afternoon again. Then \Ma has to leave as well, \Gi and me stay a bit longer. \Gi is talking to the two drunken guys and the young guy starts to talk with me again. After a while he says

\startDialog
\tell{He}{Alemão, I just wanna ask you if you can give me five Reais. Look, its nothing personal. I just wanna tell you that we need Crack now and it's better for you to leave because it will become urgent soon and you probably don't want to be here then.  It's really  important now because we had our last stone already some hours ago. So I ask you, do you have five Reais now?}
\tell{Me}{Sorry, but I gave my money the other guy....}
\tell{He}{Look, its really important for us now. How long would it take for you to go home get the money?}
\tell{Me}{I life too far away. It would take 2 hours or so to come back...}
\tell{He}{Ok, then better you get off soon and if you could get any money it would really help us much...}
\stopDialog

\Gi is approaching me and we decide to leave because the situation won't become favourable for us, so its better to say good by. The young guy then called out to us:

\startDialog
\tell{He}{Come around the other day, alemão, we are always here, around this time.}
\stopDialog

While we are slowly walking towards \locMissingSrc{Sé} and then further on to \locMissingSrc{República} \Gi said:

\startDialog
\tell{\Gi}{It was good that we left, it was not safe any more, they turn crazy when they need crack. And the next time you better don't give them money. The one guy never came back and probably also went to get some crack. One stone is just five Reais.}
\stopDialog

This was the last time I saw \Gi for a while, until I run into him some weeks later at \gotoTextMark[Praca da Sé]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_penaforte}.

\subjectCrack

Two or three weeks after we met the \gotoTextMark[four guys]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_sundaystreetscentrefourguys} at a back road of \locMissingSrc{Rua do Carmo}, I pass there nearby. I hear somebody shouting

\startDialog
\tell{}{Alemão, come here!}
\stopDialog

Its the young guy we met back then, sitting there, close to the metro entrance of \locMissingSrc{Sé}, together with a bunch of other people. We greet each other and he starts immediately:

\startDialog
\tell{He}{Alemão, I go back to my home town. I can't stand this city any more. Since I arrived here I stayed on the streets, but I cannot stand it any more. I did not find work, Crack is killing me. I'm finished with this city, I have to leave for now, getting back my life.}
\tell{Me}{Good news! When do you wanna leave?}
\tell{He}{I take the bus next Tuesday. How long do you stay?}
\tell{Me}{Till November probably.}
\tell{He}{Then we'll meet again. My plan is to return to São Paulo in October or so.}
\tell{Me}{Look, take good care and who knows, probably we'll meet again...}
\stopDialog 

We never met again.

\subjectPCC

\inright{PCC and the streets}
On another day I meet \Ma again. We are talking about the \gotoTextMark[four guys we met]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_sundaystreetscentrefourguys} at a back road of \locMissingSrc{Rua do Carmos}. \Ma asks if I have an idea who that guy in the car has been, who was stopping and asking the crowd there. I say that he is probably police or something. \Ma says that this guy was no police but that he was patrolling for the \abbrNew{Primeiro Comando do Capital}{PCC}. He was patrolling and asked the people on the street what they have seen, if something happened, if police was around. \Ma asks me if I every heard that  loud fireworks somewhere, not during football games, but just when I was in the centre. He said that those fireworks are the signals for new deliveries arriving at the \toMark{bocas de fumo} \toMark{and those patrols belonging to them}.

\inright{PCC attacks ROTA}
We continued to talk about \abbr{PCC}. Just some days ago, on the 31th of July, online and offline mass media \bracket{\aLinkMediaNew[Folha de São Paulo]{http://bit.ly/pTNkSJ},\aLinkMediaNew[Último Segundo]{http://bit.ly/d01dWz},\aLinkMediaNew[Estadão]{http://bit.ly/rnA6q0}} reported that \abbr{PCC} launched an assault on a captain of the \abbrNew{Rondas Ostensivas Tobias de Aguiar}{ROTA}, a special unit of the \abbrFull{MP} of São Paulo. Two men tried to kill a captain of the \abbr{ROTA} in front of his house when he left in the morning. One day later, during the night from Sunday to Monday, again two men shot at the head-quarter of the \abbr{ROTA} that is located right beside \locMissingSrc{Parque da Luz}, close to the city's \locMissingSrc{main train station} at \locMissingSrc{Luz}. Several journals report later on, that within 2 days after the last attack, 7 or 8 suspects have been killed by \abbr{MP} in São Paulo \bracket{\aLinkMediaNew[Radio Agência NP]{http://bit.ly/a8ciGl}, \aLinkMediaNew[Carta Capital]{http://bit.ly/d3gLpl}}.

\inright{who is PCC?}
The other day, I brought the July issue of \aQuoteInTextA{Caros Amigos}, inside an article about \abbr{PCC } called \aQuoteInText{Por dentro do PCC}\footnote{\toTranslate[Por dentro do PCC]{From within PCC}}\footnote{a shortened version of the article is \aLinkNewAlt[available online]{http://carosamigos.terra.com.br/index\_site.php?pag=revista\&id=145\&iditens=690}{http://bit.ly/o6NOs9} as well}. The article renders an interview with two anthropologist, Karina Biondi and Adalton Marques, who have conducted anthropological studies inside the prison system in Brazil\footnote{Karina Biondo: Junto e Misturado: uma ethnografia do PCC}\footnote{Adalton Marques: Crime, proceder, convívio-seguro: um experimento antropológico a partir de relacões enter ladrões}. In its introduction, the article states:

Me personally, I know little as well, my knowledge is not even partial, that's why I am seeking for more standpoints. The notion of \aKeyword[crime]{streets+standpoints+crime} and \aKeyword[jail]{streets+standpoints+jail} is omnipresent in the narrations of the people, in the narrations of the streets but also as issues for actions, for instance as a theme discussed by the \gotoTextMark[aRUAssa collective]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_aruacca_ideas} for a small film project.

\startPersonal
\abbr{PCC} is one reality of São Paulo I stumbled across but I do not aim to argue in favour or against it. For me, the situation is too complex to understand but I also do not want to neglect it because I have the feeling it is relevant to think about the reasons and manifestations of what is called crime, what is called the prison system, the police system, because they all produce the city \bracket{the lived space of society}, and they are produced by the city and affect social struggle in turn. 

\startARemark{wie kann die überleitung hier aussehen?} crackolândia, polizei, straße, crime?

This may probably be their truth but I am seeking other standpoints. Then the picture becomes blurry and gets different notions:

As principais avenidas de São Paulo nunca estão desertas. Não posso enumerar os motivos que levam as pessoas a ganhar as ruas durante a madrugada, mas um deles conheço bem: é o dia de visita nas cadeias.

\inright{social movements affected by \quote{crime}}
Returning to \quote{the crime}, \Ma talks about another invisible face of the streets. He explained that at some of the place we visited, houses have been converted from occupations of social movements to illegal apartment complexes. He says that occupations of social movements are sometimes infiltrated by \quote{the crime} \bracket{according to his notion}. In those cases social movements are slowly drawn out by drug dealers for instance. Once the building has been entirely overtaken, rooms are prepared for renting and the building, initially occupied by social movement due to a lack of affordable housing, serves as an illegal apartment complex, generating profit. 

We have been in such a house, a former an industrial building, several floors high. Once this building was overtaken, walls have been brought up inside, establishing new rooms on each floor, ready to rent. In that house, probably 5 apartments are residing on each floor. The one where we have been was not very large, one room, a kitchen and sanitation.

Organized occupations are attempting to prevent such a development by defining and applying rules of conduct within their buildings. The \gotoTextMark[interview we made with people]{text mark missing interview} of a hotel occupied by \abbrNew{Frente da Luta por Moradia}{FLM} at \locMissingSrc{Avenida Ipiranga} is bringing this matter up as well. 

\subjectVeganLunch

\inright{at Ay Carmela again}
Every last Sunday a month, the \aKeyword[collectively cooked vegan]{streets+actions+collective lunch} lunch at \Ay is my favourite place to be. For me such a day is important in various ways. 

First and foremost the lunch offers space for socializing. Its an event  open for everybody, starting at noon and organized by the \aKeyword[Ay Camela collective]{streets+actors+collectives+ay carmela}. Is a place for meeting friends and to get in touch with other persons. For me as a stranger this is important. The lunch is also meant to support the payment of bills of the space.

I personally love the place anyway because this is where I am coming from, what I consider important to organize and maintain, from an activist perspective. 

At \Ay I also \gotoTextMark[met friends like \Ma and \Gi]{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_sundaystreetscentregibson} or the \gotoTextMark[aRUAssa collective]{text mark missing to arruassa meeting}. 

Besides those important reasons \bracket{personally spoken}, the organization of \Ay as a self-determined space is already an action of self-determination.

\inright{who is Ay Carmela?}
\Ay offers infrastructure and space for collectives and movements to meet and organize. Even though it has to pay rent and bills, it seeks to balance them independent from institutional support, in a self-organized manner, by conducting events such as the lunch for instance \bracket{as one example of much more that has to be done}. 

I mention \Ay and the monthly lunch in particular because I would like to pick out three examples of usages and organization of the space: the \aKeyword[organic market]{streets+actions+organic market} organized by \abbrNew{Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais sem Terra}{MST}\footnote{\toTranslate[Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais sem Terra]{Movement of Landless Rural Workers} }\aLinkNewF[MST]{http://www.mst.org.br/} during the lunch, \aKeyword[recycling]{streets+actions+recycling} by a collective of \aKeyword[Catadores]{streets+actors+collectives+catadores} and meeting place of the \aKeyword[aRUAssa film collective]{streets+actors+collectives+arruassa}, the latter two described elsewhere \gotoTextMark{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_sometalks_recycling} \gotoTextMark{narratinginquiries_saopaulodiaries_aruacca}.

Usually a woman supported by several other people arrived in the morning by car, bringing their products. They set up several small tables on which they put mainly organic vegetables, herbs, fruits\footnote{Such as feijão, milho or mandjoca} and coffee produced in their settlement. 

All products are strictly organic, thus cultivated without \toTranslate[agrotóxicos]{pesticides} and \abbrNew{gene modified}{GM} plants. At the \aKeyword[mini-feira]{streets+actions+mini-feira}, 500 gram of organic coffee costs about 5 Reais, a similar price as one has to pay in cheap supermarkets \footnote{Bom Dia, for instance} for non-organic coffee. Organic coffee \bracket{as well as organic products in general} are luxury products, often only available at more expensive supermarkets \footnote{Pão de Açúcar, for instance} where it costs about 3 or 4 times as much as at the \aKeyword[mini-feira]{streets+actions+mini-feira}. \footnote{Prices can also be compared online, for instance at \aLinkNewNoF[http://www.nacional.com.br]{http://bit.ly/rqfzXn}.}

\inright{political actions}
I perceive Vegan lunch and Mini-Feira as political actions. One purpose is to maintain space, Ay Carmela through donations by offering and collectively preparing lunch, the settlement through selling food. The reason that the mini-feira can be held here, is \bracket{among others} the availability of free space provided by the place Ay Carmela. At these days, people that are engaged in social struggles in the city frequent the place, but neighbours of the surrounding area are coming around as well, probably not all for lunch but for buying organic food. They may have just seen one of the distributed flyers on the streets in the neighbourhood and usually probably just pass by.

The practised modes of production and distribution are self-determined. Distribution is self-organized, directly brought by the settlement \bracket{the producer}, without intermediate dealers, not generating profit. The gathered money is used to maintain the spaces necessary to allow this practices. 

The organic food produced by the \aKeyword[Irmã Alberta]{mst+assentamento} settlement is a luxury product accessible through luxury supermarkets. At those Sundays it is shown on a small scale that healthy food is not supposed to be a matter of affordability and monetary accessibility, that those practices of production and distribution could benefit much more people as the common modes profit oriented production and distribution.

Returning to the \aKeyword[mini-feira]{streets+actions+mini-feira} once more. One month before I had to leave São Paulo, the people of the \aKeyword[Irmã Alberta]{mst+assentamento} settlement are proposing to everyone interested to visit their settlement in order to participate in giving lessons in domains of personal knowledge and skills. They say that many of those living in the settlement will not be able to enter university because they may lack the necessary school degrees or simply cannot afford to travel by public transport to the campus everyday. Thus the settlement came up with the idea of an open university at the settlement. They said that many of them would like to learn English for example. They therefore proposed an open day for everybody to come and decide together with the people how classes could be organized for specific areas of interest, what topics are of interest, what topics could be provided, in what frequency are classes supposed to be conducted. I personally feel pity that I could not participate in that proposal because my time in the city was converging towards its end.

One could categorized all those actions as informal work and organizing, thus a practice not according to legal rules. This would lack a large part of what is actually done here. The spaces involved here are self-organized, in the city centre as well as at the fringes of the city. The practice of these actions could show a type of organizing without the notions of profit making and exploitation by freely agreeing on the terms of what could be done and how it could be done. This practice means exchange between the urban space and the space at the fringes. It includes the access to healthy and affordable food in urban space and access to knowledge and education at the fringe, according to non-discriminatory agreements made among those that are interested in pushing this practice forward. Exchange is also meant physically, by visiting each other, working collectively with each other.
