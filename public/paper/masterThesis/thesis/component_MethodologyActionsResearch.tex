I determined \aKeyMarInVi{Action Research}\abbrNew{Action Research}{AR} as the overall methodological framework for this thesis. This choice has been sudden in a sense that I honestly didn't know anything about \abbr{AR} prior to the thesis research actions. Neither in university nor for activist purposes. It is also just now, while writing this methodology chapter that I understand more comprehensively what \abbr{AR} represents and what it could include. I currently would say that my personal practice intuitively included many of the approaches \abbr{AR} can be chosen to be composed of. However, as it is the first time that I get in touch with \abbrFull{AR} as an approach to research, I can already say that I did not and could not fully assimilate it. This holds also partly true  for the thesis self conception or my personal practice and conviction, which is to a large extend the foundation of this thesis understanding of \abbr{AR}.

So, what is hidden behind the term \abbrFull{AR}? In a sense, the word \abbrFull{AR} by itself seems already matching the way I intend to do research. This may be a relatively weak justification but nonetheless it nearly hits the mark. \inright{the thesis notion of \abbrFull{AR}} is research that emerges from within a \aKeyMarVi{social movement}, from within the struggle against the peoples oppression and discrimination, by playing an active role in the \aKeyMarVi{movement theorizing}, in the movements analysis of the reality it is embedded in and in the intended transformation of this reality \aQuoteB{Morell}{2009}{40}. 

Even though I refer here to social movements as collectives or groups of marginalized people \footnote
{
social movements are not necessarily mass movements for me, and in the context of this thesis I mean any kind of group or collective, no matter its size or outreach. \aQuoteInTextA{Marge Piercy} wrote in her poem \aQuoteInTextT{The Low Road}\aLinkNewF{http://www.margepiercy.com/sampling/The_Low_Road.htm} \aQuoteY{2006} that a social movement \startCitation goes on one at a time; It starts when you care to act, it starts when you do it again after they said no; It starts when you say we and know what you mean, and each day you mean one more \aQuoteB{Marge Piercy in Hall}{2009}{48}\stopCitation
}
, whose intention is the resistance against existing oppressive power structures and their transformation into an \bracket{more} emancipatory power, \abbr{AR} as mere methodology is also used in other contexts \aQuoteB{Morell}{2009}{21}, \inright{other notions of \abbrFull{AR}} as a research praxis that may even contradict emancipatory praxis, ie. in international development \aLinkNewF{http://blogs.worldbank.org/category/tags/action-research}\aLinkNewF{http://www.lga.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=2420}\aLinkNewF{http://blogs.helsinki.fi/tzredd-actionresearch/}. In the course of this thesis I am always referring to my first notion of \abbrFull{AR}.

\inright{workers inquiry}
In practice, one instance of movement theorizing through \abbr{AR} is \aKeyMarVi{workers inquiry}, the subjective workers view on and analysis of the situation of the workers in the fabric, of being exploited and alienated, their knowledge about their needs and the necessary transformation according to those needs. \aKeyMarVi{workers inquiry} emerged from within a movement, conducted by the activists, the workers, themselves. In Italy for example, visible in the \aKeyMarInVi{Operaismo}\toTranslate[Workerism]{Operaismo} movement that originated from debates in the journal \aKeyMarInVi{Quaderni Rossi}\toTranslate[Red Notebook]{Quaderni Rossi} in the early sixties of the 20th century, which finally led to the Italian workers' struggle at the end of that decade \aQuoteW{Wildcat}{1995} \aLinkNewF{http://www.wildcat-www.de/wildcat/64/w64opera.htm}.

If one thus looks at social movements and collectives and their organized struggle, one can perceive the production and articulation of own content and analysis of the particular reality, in order to develop the necessary step(s) to transform and overcome it. Here, knowledge emerges from within the struggle and is supposed to facilitate it \aQuoteW{Barker, Cox}{2001}.

\spaceHalf

\startCitation
In this perspective, movement theorizing is an aspect of the work that people do as they try to create institutions (movements) that will enable them (indirectly, through a change in the social order) to meet needs that are not currently being met.\aQuoteW{Barker, Cox}{2001}.
\stopCitation

Different notions of theorizing, knowledge and content can be distinguished here, notions that are relevant for this thesis research \bracket{there are much more notions that are not considered here} which is grounded on actions conducted in a social world:

\spaceHalf

\textBoxedRoundMaxDef
{
\inright{academic theorizing and empirical research}
\aKeyMarVi{Academic Theorizing} assumes that knowledge can be created independent of the existing social order, that it is therefore not biased by its producer, its point of view and the existing social context \aQuoteB{Sprague and Kobrynowicz}{2004}{31}, that it is formulated based on the neutral and systematic observation of facts and real world situations, an observation where the academic observer and his/her subject of observation are distinct\aQuoteB{Juris}{2007}{171}. This distinction also reproduces the social order, theorizing remains merely a theorizing about the subject of research which reinforces the distinction between the privileged \bracket{scholar} and the oppressed \bracket{subject of research}. Observed and described facts and evidences are supposed to be reproducible in order to be analysable and explicable \aQuoteB{Sprague and Kobrynowicz}{2004}{26}, only so they are considered valid for academic theorizing and can become relevant for the derivation of corresponding generalized theories and \quote{generic propositions} \aQuoteW{Barker and Cox}{2001}. 
}

\spaceHalf

\textBoxedRoundMaxDef
{
\inright{movement theorizing and action research}
\aKeyMarVi{Movement Theorizing} is concerned with a concrete struggle, formulated by the direct necessity of the people to change a situation that constraints their individual well being and freedom \aQuoteW{Gramsci in Barker and Cox}{2001}. \aKeyMarVi{Movement Theorizing} incorporates the existing social order \aQuoteB{Sprague and Kobrynowicz}{2004}{31}. It is formulated from a subjective position according to personal or collective needs, formulated through praxis and actions, from a pragmatic and directly affected viewpoint \aQuoteW{Barker and Cox}{2001}, destined to transform and overcome the current structures of oppression \aQuoteB{Sprague and Kobrynowicz}{2004}{35}. \aKeyMarVi{Movement Theorizing} is in movement, continuously adjusting to the changes of the environment it is emerging from, to the impacts of the struggle it facilitates \aQuoteW{Barker and Cox}{2001}. It comes from below and is inconvenient for those that are interested in keeping the world as it is \aQuote{Fox and Fominaya}{2009}{1}. It does not break down its environment into atomic units, stripped off their context, then analysed statically, but draws upon a flora of actions and situations, each of them able to change the direction \aKeyMarVi{Movement Theorizing} is pursuing \aQuoteB{Routeledge}{1996a}{516}.

I wanted to draw some attention to those examples because I perceive \abbr{AR} as a valid and emancipated approach for conducting research and theorizing. My conception of \abbrFull{AR} \bracket{and those of the given examples} originate from the people and their particular realities and struggles. The produced knowledge and content is the result of peoples intellectual work, which has for me the same significance as knowledge produced in the academic space \bracket{or in journalism for instance}. \inright{partial knowledge} Knowledge is partial, not absolute, no matter from where it originates, because it is created out of a particular situation, out of a particular social context and its relations, with a particular focus and perspective, from a particular standpoint. Therefore it does not represent a singular and mystical, one and only truth that is naturally given or justified \aQuote{Haraway}{1994}{157}.

[...]\startCitation
each subject is specific, located in a particular time and place. Thus a knower has a particular perspective on the object. At the same time, this locatedness gives access to the concrete world; knowing is not relative, [...] , rather it is partial \aQuoteB{Haraway}{1988} and \aQuoteB{Hartsock}{1983} in \aQuoteB{Sprague and Kobrynowicz}{2004}{27}
\stopCitation

Hence this thesis privileges the standpoint of the marginalized people of the streets of São Paulo. Certainly, the form of knowledge creation, distribution and adoption differs from the \bracket{constructed} norm of academic theorizing, but \aQuoteInTextA{Barker and Cox} nicely describe this difference as at least complementary rather then contradictory when they write that theorizing in struggle

\spaceHalf

\startCitation
can be usefully understood as theoretical because it is not simply a product of \quote{the situation} or \quote{folk culture}, but is rather a process of ongoing intellectual engagement, whose results [...] shift over time. [...] [it] is grounded in the process of producing \quote{social movements} against opposition. It is always to some extent knowledge-in-struggle, and its survival and development is always contested and in process of formation. Its frequently partial, unsystematic and provisional character does not make it any the less worth our attention, though it may go some way towards explaining why academic social movements theory is too often content with taking the 'cream off the top', and disregarding - or failing to notice - everything that has to happen before institutionalized social movement theorizing appears in forms that can be easily appropriated. \aQuoteW{Barker and Cox}{2001}
\stopCitation

Looking at the time in São Paulo, I would say that \abbr{AR} has been the consequential way of being together with the people from the streets, collaborating with them, participating in their actions. This was possible because I left the academic space I was bounded to \bracket{due to the fact I write this thesis in an academic framework} during my time in the city.

I also choose \abbr{AR}, because I think that the knowledge and conceptualisation of the situation on the streets, formulated by the very people from the streets, is an enrichment for academic work in the sense that it could engage people to become more active, contest the status the academic space represents and by that introduce other ways of thinking, theorizing and adopting it. Such an engagement back on the streets, in social life, for an emancipatory transformation, shows that the private is politically, that research is political. The socially constructed spaces of academia and those spaces it aims to explain and conceptualize are supposed to be de-constructed in order to really facilitate a transformation \aQuoteB{Routeledge}{1996b}{400} and not to just reproduce the current status \bracket{which is build upon capitalism, race, gender, patriarchy, violence, power}. Therefore I make plenty of use of the information and content provided and created by the people, along with my personal and collective experiences and academic theories. 

Continuing with the justification of choosing \abbr{AR} as main methodological framework for this thesis, I found the work of \aQuoteInTextA{Morell} quite helpful. \aQuoteInTextA{Morell} conceptualized in his article \aQuoteInTextT{Action research: mapping the nexus of research and political action}\aQuoteY{2009} different tendencies that are aimed to be achieved when conducting \abbrFull{AR} and of whom some have been briefly described already. In short, these five main tendencies are

\startitemize
\item {\ss participative-collective methods} 
\item {\ss producing alternative content} alternative content can be any form of publication and media that transport knowledge 
\item {\ss developing strategic thinking for broad political processes }
\item {\ss building relationships and networking connections}
\item {\ss opening knowledge}

One justification of AR is that one must be there on the local level, one must see and experience the local space in order to understand the situation (see Tsing, Friction)

This knowledge tries to answer questions such as - What do we want? Who are we? What do we need to do?

\stopAReminder

\abbr{AR} is said to be favourable for research that intends to work for a social transformation of an inequitable situation \aQuoteB{}{}{}. 

This may not be the only area of application because \abbr{AR} is not bounded to a specific attitude but rather represent a set of tools that can be used for basically any purpose, thus \abbr{AR} is applied in corporations \aQuoteB{}{}{}, as well as in social movements research \aQuoteB{}{}{} or by activists themselves \aQuoteW{Periferies Urbanes}{2010}\aLinkNewF{http://periferiesurbanes.org/?p=165&lang=en}.

Hence, \abbrFull{AR} is a organic framework consisting of various concrete methodologies, that depend on the context it is applied in. 

\startAReminder

One attribute of \abbr{AR} is its participative research approach. 

im empierischen teil kann ich mit einer karte der bewegungen und orte in são paulo beginnen

außedem eine unterteilung in situation, aktion und organisation?

nochmal drauf hinweisen das ich nicht hundertprozentiger teil einer bewegung war, sondern einzelne menschen aus bewegungen kennenlernte, die teilweise in bewegungen organisiert waren, ich also keinen research mit einer bewegung gemacht habe, sondern mit menschen, und mit den prozessen der stadt(!)

I do not want to observe oppresed people through the lens of the the privileged. 
\stopAReminder

\startAReminder
es muß nochmal deutlich werden das ich als bewegung nicht nur zum MNPR meine sonderen auch strukturierte und lose kollektive! also nicht nur massenbewegungen

goals, relate self-determined action to the city, its spaces and places, and to the cities concepts of exlusion and the self determined praxis against it

urban exclusion: (forms of gentrification, forms of spatial in(justice), forms of architectural opression )

more objectives: nutururing people, nuturing academia, nuturing me

co-theorizing sollte noch erwähnt werden am ende, also nicht nur das schreiben der arbeit. steht in dem text über AR in kolumbien

One note though on my role in the contradicting spaces of academia \bracket{as a student} and the streets \bracket{as an activist}. It has been shown that \abbr{AR}, as it is presented here, is a research approach for \aKeyMarVi{movement theorizing}, is thus part of a movements praxis and struggle. Even though I feel sympathetic to the people and support their demands and struggles, show my solidarity and participate in their actions, I had no sufficient time to get really engaged in a continuous and structural manner in existing struggles, may they be occupations for housing or another type of transformation of the street reality, to name just a few right now.  I therefore remained somehow in an intermediate space, not really diving completely into the street reality nor staying outside as a sole observer. I would therefore say that my thesis is not to full extend a work from an activist perspective, from within, but surely it is not about the streets from an academic perspective, even though it incorporates academic knowledge. Probably this space I feel myself located into, is a space 

\spaceHalf

\startCitation where neither site, role, nor representation holds sway, where one continually subverts the other \aQuoteB{Routledge}{1996b}{400} in \aQuoteB{Juris}{173}{2007}.\stopCitation

\spaceHalf

What literally remained completely out of reach is a \aKeyMarVi{collaborative writing} or \aKeyMarVi{co-theorizing} process. Before I continue I just want to cite a fraction of a definition of contemporary \aKeyMarVi{collaborative ethnography} \bracket{even though I do not consider me an ethnographer} because I would say that this definition, still very formal, fits in its core the approach that I intend(ed) to use, which 

\spaceHalf

[...]\startCitation 
deliberately and explicitly emphasizes collaboration at every point in the ethnographic process, without veiling it—from project conceptualization, to fieldwork, and, especially, through the writing process. Collaborative ethnography invites commentary from our consultants and seeks to make that commentary overtly part of the ethnographic text as it develops. In turn, this negotiation is reintegrated back into the fieldwork process itself. \aQuoteB{Lassiter in Rappaport}{2008}{1}
\stopCitation

\spaceHalf

Thus, here its is again, that contradiction between academic and activist researcher. For a collaborative writing process, which would return its results back to the people as well, was no space. And due to the fact that activist knowledge is fluid and progressing, further reflections on the once produced content and the resulting action would be necessary, which means that cycles of collaborative writing, reflection, action and re-writing would be required. Here, mainly time constraints but also the constraints of the academic space come into play again. As already mentioned in the introduction of this \refMissingSrc{methodology chapter}, the plain time I spend together with the people has been basically three month, thus it was not even possible to start thinking about a collaborative writing process. This process could have started after those initial month' of participating and experiencing, but at this time, I had already to return to Germany. From my point of view, a collaborative writing and feedback process would have required several month, especially when thinking about the conditions this process would have been realized under.

Being back in Germany means that the direct contact to the people has been lost. The possibility to hang around with them, to meet here and there, in the city, in cultural and political spaces, somewhere on the streets. Contact is therefore only possible through digital communication which makes a collaborative writing process impossible for me. We use the \aKeyMarVi{Internet}, \aKeyMarVi{Email}, \aKeyMarVi{Facebook} or \aKeyMarVi{Orkut}, but for more than one way communication we are not prepared. Even if we would, double effort had to be put in translation work because in my case it is fundamentally important to communicate in Portuguese, which would mean to translate all produced content into English at least as well, if necessary also into German. This situation would be the optimum but my current reality does not provide space and time for such as effort. A deadline must be kept. The alternative would have been to stay longer but just plain visa issues would not even allow that.

So, what to do then? Basically that what is done usually, I write just by myself in order to keep the deadline for this thesis, I will try to translate important parts into Portuguese afterwards, make everything accessible online on the \aLinkF[thesis blog]{https://rtc.noblogs.org}  and will try to keep the contacts alive, try to organize some events on grassroots level to distribute information about the São Paulo experience.
