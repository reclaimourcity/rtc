\subsectionRightToHousing

The \magentaBold{Right to Housing} is one claim by street people in order to leave the streets but it is also a main theme by urban social movements which is pushed forward through large scale \magentaBold{occupation of empty properties} in the city.  \magentaBold{Right to Housing} is also the struggle against real estate speculation and the massive vacancy in the city, the demolition of old not representable quarters, for example at Luz, with its accompanying gentrification effects and the further expulsion of marginalized and poor people.
