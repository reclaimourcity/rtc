Before I start I would like to shortly address the complexity of the worlds I have perceived. I will not try to give everything an order, assign too much functions and roles to people, places or actions. That short snapshot taken by research actions is also a my memory, the memory of that particular time that I spend with people and that that they spend with me. Therefore I would like to denote the subjects of that memory, even though in a simplistic manner, in order given notions of the sensible embedded in the \gotoTextMark[already mentioned questions]{methodology_intro} \WhoAreWe \WhatDoWeWant \WhatShouldWeDo. Those notions are sensible in the spaces created by social struggle, and in the spaces that enforce social struggle due to its structural inequalities and could hopefully catch a glimpse on what social transformations actually  are and could further be possible through social struggle and actions in urban spaces and beyond.

The notions in the following \toMark{visualisation} emerged organically, they are representing mainly what I have been in touch with more frequently, what is noted in my narrations more frequently as well.
