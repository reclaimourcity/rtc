\blueBold{Education} is a goal of many actions due to the fact that access to other learning institutions is often denied and people must organize their education by themselves.  \blueBold{Education} is thus an objective of many workshops in \greenBold{cultural and self-organized centres} such as \greenBold{OCAS} and \greenBold{Ay Carmela}.
