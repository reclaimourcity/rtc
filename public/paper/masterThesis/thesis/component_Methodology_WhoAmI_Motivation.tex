Personal \aKeyword[motivations]{thesis+motivations} and \aKeyword[demands]{thesis+demands} on \bracket{my} \aKeyword[research actions]{thesis+research actions} hold a pivotal role, as of now more than \bracket{academic} \aKeyword[relevance]{research+relevance} which will be addressed in a \goto{later chapter}[methodology::whoami::relevance]. 

My motivations and demands are of subjective nature. \aKeyword[Subjectivity]{subjectivity} has already been briefly mentioned in the \goto{introductory paragraph}[methodology::intro] of the Methodology chapter and is a topic worth mentioning \bracket{briefly} again in order to make the demands on my research transparent. Later on, when I argue for \goto{Action Research}[methodology::whoami::actionresearch] as the thesis' research framework, further notions of \aKeyword[subjectivity]{subjectivity} and specific \aKeyword[standpoints]{standpoint} will be considered from the viewpoint of \aKeyword[knowledge production]{knowledge+production}.

\inright{revelation of subjective positions}
To begin with, I would like to reveal my subjective position in this research. In a sense I am a \aKeyword{subjective observer} and, as shown later on, to a certain extend an \aKeyword{observed subject} as well due to the fact that I did not just passively observe my surroundings but also actively participated in it. For me it is important to reveal those facts in order to uncover the steps that are necessary to tie a red line through this thesis

\startCitation
As every investigating subject is different, her social position, and her political
values, should be explicitly clarified so to put a light on the question of subjectivity. Nonetheless this confession, necessary on one side, is not by itself sufficient to control the effects of the investigation, neither it is to clarify completely the author’s socio-political distortion. The way to Knowledge in precise science is usually filtered by a measuring tool, while in social sciences it is filter by a subjective observer. On one side it is proper to describe the measuring tool, on the other it is correct to reveal subjective positions. But none of these epistemological path will get to the understand of pure Reality.  \aQuoteB{Cattaneo}{2006}{20}

\inright{subjective positions already uncovered}
Some of my subjective positions and impressions have already been formulated in the notes about my \goto{São Paulo experience}[methodology::whoami::experience]. These notes represent a first \aKeyword[reflection]{who am I?+reflection} about this thesis and its research action(s) and bundle statements that formulate a basic \aKeyword[self-conception]{self-conception+basic}as...

\inright{research is political}
I conceive my thesis and its research actions as inherently \aKeyword[political]{research+is political}. Political due to the fact that I consider it as a medium that supports and to a certain extends reproduces the struggle of the people I collaborated with. Political as well because I understand my research actions as the intention to act in a non-hierarchical and \aKeyword[emancipatory]{research+emancipatory} manner (even though I can not achieve this to full extend). I understand \aKeyword[non-hierarchical]{research+non-hierarchical} and \aKeyword{emancipatory} praxis as a critique of the status quo of current social praxis. 

In my utopia, emancipation and genuine participation could create spaces at all levels of the city that would not function according to the excluding logic of the currently existing ones, according to the logic of those spaces that are representing and \bracket{re}producing social discrimination. Actions performed in those space could have the potential to either transform them or create new ones where discrimination and its roots are not existing any more or are at least contested and progressively dismantled. 

\spaceHalf

\inright{space is political}
Therefore I conceive \aKeyword[space as political]{space+is political}. It is political because the space the city represents \bracket{here, the space of the the street population in São Paulo}, is the space of resistance and struggle for transformation, the space where a multitude of realities unfold, the space where my personal practice unfolds, as well as this thesis' research actions.

\spaceHalf

\inright{strident communication as a building block towards social transformation is \aKeyword[relevant]{research+relevance}}
My position that this thesis is a complementary component of existing struggles of street people in São Paulo, does not mean that I expect concrete social change as its direct result and outcome. For me, provoking social transformation goes far beyond the scope of this work, far beyond the scope of the frame it is embedded in and constraint by. However, I think that every step towards an emancipatory and self-determined transformation of society is worthwhile to undertake. Therefore I hope this thesis could contribute to undertake further steps into that direction and to function as least as a \aKeyword[strident mean of communication and information distribution]{objectives+general} for that purpose. 

\spaceHalf

\inright{strident communication is possible by open access to information}
In order to be strident \footnote{here in the sense of the German meaning \quote{plakativ}} and probably provoke ideas, reactions or critiques, this thesis and its content have to be \aKeyword[freely accessible]{knowledge+open access}. I also believe that open access to information is desirable in general because this thesis' content is drawn on other people's knowledge, that shared it with me for instance or inspired me to reflect on my what I know. Therefore I cannot and do not want to restrict what others shared freely. Open access enforces the political aspect of my research because it undermines current \abbrNew{intellectual property}{IP} rights \aKeywordInVi{intellectual property}. \abbr{IP} equals the denial of access to knowledge and a continuing \aKeyword[economic utilization]{knowledge+economic utilization} of a \aKeyword[commodity]{knowledge+commodification} called \quote{knowledge}. I think that knowledge restricted by \abbr{IP} cannot benefit society because society possesses no means for access and use.

\inright{research becomes relevant if it can contribute to an emancipatory social transformation}
A \bracket{political} \aKeyword{self-conception} of my thesis and its intended research action(s) is desirable for me  and could probably permit my research action(s) to contribute, even though just to a small extent, to an \aKeyword{emancipatory} \aKeyword{social transformation}. Then I would consider my research as \aKeyword[relevant]{research+relevance}. Therefore I would like to denote my additional positions on order to complete my \aKeyword[demands]{research+demands} on my thesis as ...

\spaceHalf

\placefigure[force]{An attempt to determine personal motivation and demands: Part II}
{
\textBoxedRoundMaxDef[0.4]{... relevant to consider my research action(s) as political. }
\textBoxedRoundMaxDef[0.4]{... relevant to consider my research as small building block towards a a social transformation which should be strident in order to distribute information.}
\textBoxedRoundMaxDef[0.4]{... an attempt to make the information this thesis provides freely accessible and usable and not just locked-in the academic space.}
\textBoxedRoundMaxDef[0.4]{  thus, I prefer open access to all information, narratives and thoughts this thesis is composed of.}
\textBoxedRoundMaxDef[0.4]{... an attempt to turn something present but invisible or masked out into something visible but not as a invention of something completely new.}
\textBoxedRoundMaxDef[0.4]{  thus, I prefer to evoke a reaction and not just a sole analytical and systematically sound reproduction of \bracket{a} \quote{reality}.}
\textBoxedRoundMaxDef[0.4]{... an attempt to decouple the question of relevance of research action(s) from the \bracket{western} scientific norm of being innovative, objective and systematic, in order to examine situations solely on an atomic level, which masks out the context those situations have been embedded in,}
\textBoxedRoundMaxDef[0.4]{  thus, I prefer to work qualitative and event driven instead of systematic and quantitative, in order to make as many of contingent experiences as possible}
}

\spaceHalf	

The hereby presented \bracket{subjective} \aKeyword[motivations]{research+motivations} and \aKeyword[demands]{research+demands}, compose the basic layer this thesis is build upon. The very first demand of \aKeyword[non-authoritarian]{research+non-authoritarian} and \aKeyword[non-hierarchical]{research+non-hierarchical} praxis pervades in a sense all other positions. Therefore I would like to draw attention on this demand in order to clarify its fundamental importance for me.

\startARemark{muß eigentlich in ein anderes kapitel}

I could even go as far as to say that this thesis could also be considered as another type of self-determined action, because I considered it as a component of a struggle and it was made possible by genuine participation between \toMark{us}. I actually don't know in how far this kind of closed loop positively contributes to the thesis' form and content or in how far it would cancel out the narratives of other actions which are supposed to be included here in the first place. propositions can also be found in
