This repositoy contains a regular backup of all papers and the thesis that I am currently writing for my masters degree. All documents are written in ConTexT, a Tex derivate. I tried to separate templates and commands from content in order to provide generic templates that could be used for other projects as well. This is still work in progress and changes in srucutre may occure frequently.
