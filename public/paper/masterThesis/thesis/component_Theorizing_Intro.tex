\chapterTheorizing

This last map is first of all an invitation for further elaboration and criticizing.

This map is drawn as a proposal ,from a \standpoint that aims for social transformation. A \standpoint that is visible, practised and demanded by the social struggles in São Paulo. Correspondingly, my \rhizomaticMap includes tracings of themes about \Citizenship, \Participation, the \RightToTheCity, \SelfDetermination and \Politics and proposes to imagine emancipatory praxis. Therefore it contest the very same themes loaded with different meaning, meaning articulated from the \standpoint of public institutions, the state or \bracket{inter}national agencies, thus the \standpoint of actual power holders.

The proposal aims to give those themes a different sense, to \reconstruct them with emancipatory content and show how practice could and does already elaborate around it. By reconstructing I mean to inject other meaning into those words that are \bracket{most likely} familiar to us and which are \bracket{most likely} associated to a particular meaning, probably determined by public discourse led by power holders or the discourse that is hold in society.

In a sense this theorizing proposal could be perceived as a critique of the current  status quo that the society, and in turn the city, represents, where those are discriminated and oppressed that are differing from or dropping out the mainstream public discourse, that do not want or cannot act as it is required in terms of social norms, duties and obligations. 

But rather then merely criticising by producing just another set of words and phrases that say what has already been said many times, the aim of \theorizing could be extended in order to draw on what people are self-determinately organizing and practising already, to draw on the self-conceptions and attitudes that are already formulated, practised, reflected upon and overthrown if considered inappropriate or not sufficient.

\inright{theorizing as proposal \bracket{and critique}}
Thus my aim would be then to make a proposal and to see where it would lead to, how it could contemplate other proposals that are aiming for emancipatory social transformation as well but that are probably using a different language, different sets of concepts, formulated from different standpoints.

\inright{stripping off co-opted and depoliticized meaning: deconstruction of themes}
I think the first step necessary would be the \deconstruction of the commonly accepted meaning of words in order to perceive which power hierarchies are embedded in them. Once dismantling is done, a different sense can be injected. Deconstruction is critique but its formulation is just the first step.

I would also not like to invent new expressions or themes. In my opinion, what is written shall remain understandable and should not be hidden behind a complex web of language and words that only specialists familiar with the topic can understand. Using familiar sets of words and expressions could also help to argue about social struggle in terms that are understandable by those remaining outside the struggles.

\spaceHalf

\inright{injecting critical and emancipatory content: reconstruction of themes}
Therefore I would like to use themes and words like \participation even though they are heavily contested as we will see soon. This would then be the second step of theorizing, gaining back the meaning of words that are often co-opted and tamed by public, political and institutional discourse, stripped off their political and critical attitude. \Reconstruction of themes means injection of critical and emancipatory content.

The themes for theorizing have already been determined. They are articulated through social struggles on the streets of São Paulo, in campaigns and movement theorizing, in individual discussions, in particular actions. 

I would like to complement them by a few more ideas: the idea of \politics and \police as imagined by \JRanciere which may impact the way participation is de- and re-constructed - the idea of \sspace as imagined by \HLefebvre in order facilitate the imagination of the spaces we struggle in, the spaces we life in, the spaces the city represents and creates, how those spaces affect us and how we affect them, how the imagination of space could probably broaden the ability to  formulate critiques, demands, proposals and benefit actions and practices aimed for social transformation - the idea of \minDifference and \maxDifference as imagined by \HLefebvre as well, that I perceive as a basic concept for a just city, for genuine \participation in society, for the \rightToTheCity.

I do not intend to theorize about the state or concepts of democracy in particular, about available categories one can relate themes like \citizenship to. I will make use of available categories if they help me to argue and to explain but principally I would like to remain abstract.
