This repository contains a regular backup of all papers and the thesis that I am currently writing for my masters degree. All documents are written in ConTexT, a Tex derivative. I tried to separate templates and commands from content in order to provide generic templates that could be used for other projects as well. This is still work in progress and changes in structure may occur frequently. 

In order to compile the thesis document, clone the complete repository and run the project file 

* product_Thesis.tex

through your ConTexT compiler. The thesis product file which includes all chapters and the individual chapter and section files can be found under

* https://github.com/reclaimourcity/rtc/blob/master/public/paper/masterThesis/thesis/
